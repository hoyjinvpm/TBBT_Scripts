<i>Howard</i>Ah. Very nice. What's Leonard gonna do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Let's find out. Leonard, ready? (<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ready.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Go.<br>
(Raj and Howard hums in unison the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%28film_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Mission Impossible</b> theme) (Buzzer sounds)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Damn it. I slipped.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and <b title='substance sealed in a container under pressure'>aerosol</b> disinfectant, I must <b title='give up willingly'>forfeit</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because it's almost 11:00.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So Penny has a "Don't knock on my door before 11:00 or I punch you in the throat" rule.<br>
<i>All</i>Ah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, you know what would be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't wanna see naked.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You underestimate me.
<s>The hallway. Sheldon's looking at his watch, waiting.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Covering his throat) It's 11 a. m.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know. You're safe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This package came while you were at work.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, great, my <b title='a jewel made from glass or a transparent rock that is intended to look like a diamond'>rhinestones</b>. Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have to sign this.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When I signed for the package, I was <b title='↗delegate'>deputized</b> by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I'm fully <b title='indemnify - protect against damage, loss, or injury ↗reimburse'>indemnified</b> and no longer <b title='responsible by law'>liable</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, the contents are irrelevant. A legal <b title='the act of delivering goods or personal property to another in trust'>bailment</b> has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bailment, describes a relationship in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law">Wiki</a>] ↗civil law'>common law</b>, where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels is transferred from one person, the bailer, to another person, the bailee.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Look, look. I started a business.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Obviously not a cleaning business.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. I'm making flower <b title='a small plastic or metal object used for keeping a woman&#039;s hair in place =hair-slide'>barrettes</b>. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself and all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in <b title='the old town of a city or town is its historic or original core'>old town</b>. She sells cards and home-made jewelry. She says she wanted to sell them, I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good for you. Sign here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Another waitress?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's her name?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you're going to let her handle my food?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nancy. Her name is Nancy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think you're just making that up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don't wanna be a waitress for the rest of my life.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine. Cheeseburger.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Maybe I'd be <b title='happier, improved, more successful etc'>better off</b> with Nancy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How many of these can you make a day?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm. About 20.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. Like 50 cents. I'm not sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, of course you're not. All right. Ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is $2600.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's all?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Before taxes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe the <b title='IRS [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service">Wiki</a>]'>Internal Revenue Service</b> would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, you optimized your manufacturing process, you might make this a <b title='feasible'>viable</b> business.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And you know about that stuff?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. I'm a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who's <b title=' an English rock band [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Wiki</a>]'>Radiohead</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course I could. (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, wait. Will you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just to be clear here. You're asking for my assistance.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I understand.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or <b title='criticizing sb/sth in an unkind and indirect way ↗sneer'>snide</b> to me while I'm doing so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Reluctantly) Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. Let's begin with the premise that everything you've done up to this point is wrong.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, imagine that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sarcasm. Goodbye.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I'm sorry. Wait. Please, come back.
<s>Penny's living room. She's making a Penny Blossom. Sheldon's timing her.</s>
<i>Penny</i>There. Done.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Twelve minutes and 17 seconds.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, pretty good, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you'll <b title='↗efficient'>effectively</b> be paying yourself $5.19 a day.<br>
<i>Penny</i>A day?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who out-earn you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That just can't be right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're questioning my math?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you like me to show my work?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Are you familiar with the development that resulted from <b title='a French gunsmith and a pioneer of the use of interchangeable parts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_Blanc">Wiki</a>]'>Honoré Blanc</b>'s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? (Penny just stares at him blankly) The assembly line, of course.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be <b title='↗contempt, patronize'>condescending</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That wasn't a part of our original agreement and I do not agree to it now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're thinking of the moving assembly line. An understandable, but not excusable, mistake. Now, the moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn't one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.
<s>Leonard and Sheldon's living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Let's go. We're gonna miss the coming attractions.<br>
(Howard groans)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.<br>

Please pay attention and listen to me / Give me some time to blow the man down / I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong / Give me way, hey, blow the man down / If you give me some whiskey I'll sing you a song / Give me some time to blow the man down) (Leonard, Raj and Howard enter)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Penny & Sheldon</i>(In unison) Hello. Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop / To me, way hey, blow the man down / Or I'll help you along with the toe of me boot / Give me some time to blow the man down<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I assume you're referring to the sea shanty. It's a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. It's crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Terrific, but that kinda raises more questions than it answers.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny's making hair accessories. I'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break's over. Pay attention to orders, now, you one and all-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hot glue.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're kidding. Any of the <b title='氰基丙烯酸盐粘合剂 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate">Wiki</a>]'>cyanoacrylates</b> would do a better job.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It won't work. The flower's too <b title='allowing liquid or air to pass through slowly'>porous</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What if we infused the bottom layer with <b title='室温硫化硅橡胶 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTV_silicone">Wiki</a>]'>silicone RTV</b> to provide a better mounting surface?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='↗intrigued, interested, interesting'>Intriguing</b>. (Raj whispers something in Howard's ear)<br>
<i>Howard</i>A good question. What are your marketing and distribution channels?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, there're the waitresses at my work, and this cute little shop in old town-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hush, hush, hush. Virtually nonexistent. I'm thinking that we set her up with a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service">Wiki</a>]'>hosted</b> <b title='ready to be used immediately'>turnkey</b> e-commerce system to start.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why not eliminate the <b title='an intermediary such as a wholesaler or a reseller'>middle man</b>. We could install a small <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_farm">Wiki</a>]'>server farm</b> with a static IP in her bedroom.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She'll need some kind of industrial cooling system.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. But before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced <b title='sparkle'>glitter</b> <b title='a small mash of sth'>clump</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, it's a <b title='sth unpleasant'>bitch</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, I've seen this before.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Eww.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you thinking about adding a <b title='substance that absorbs moisture'>desiccant</b> like <b title='硫酸钙 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_sulfate">Wiki</a>]'>calcium sulfate</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But, sure, calcium sulfate could work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let's <b title='solve a problem by trying to think of it in a different way'>think out of the box</b> for a moment. How about a molecular <b title='an object that you pour a liquid or mixture through to remove the solid or largest pieces ↗sift'>sieve</b>?<br>
<i>Boys</i>Ohhh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I-I've got a spaghetti <b title='a kitchen tool with lots of small holes in it'>strainer</b> in the kitchen. (Awkward silence)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, we could <b title='steal'>liberate</b> some <b title='micro + porous'>microporous</b> charcoal from the chem lab.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, great. Raj, why don't you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don't you start working on some <b title='coming before the main or most important part of sth'>preliminary</b> website designs. I'll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what's wrong with my apartment?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not my apartment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, wait, what am I gonna do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, it's your business. Do whatever you want.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Okay. Cool. I'm gonna take a nap.
<s>Sheldon and Leonard's living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm still <b title='tweak - make small changes'>tweaking</b> things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the website. So, what do you guys think? (Raj whispers something in Howard's ear)<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, <b title='almost'>pretty much</b> any way I say that is gonna hurt his feelings.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, what's wrong with it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's wrong with it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not you. I wasn't asking you. Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh. Well, it's a little <b title='immature, childish'>juvenile</b>. I mean, it kind of looks like the <b title='a social networking service [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">Wiki</a>]'>MySpace</b> page of a 13-year-old girl.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it doesn't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Aw, please. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>Dateline</b> could use it to attract predators.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, this is your enterprise, so it's ultimately your decision. But based on the quality of his work, I'd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna fire me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny's decision. Penny?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job, then why do we already have orders?<br>
<i>Penny</i>We do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No kidding. Two?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh. Look at the comments.<br>
<i>Penny</i>"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These'll be perfect to cover my bald spots." Aww. Yeah. That is so <b title='pleasing'>sweet</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='camouflage - hide'>Camouflaging</b> bald spots. That's primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How are flower barrettes gonna appeal to men?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We add <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">Wiki</a>]'>Bluetooth</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You wanna make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='general exclamation'>Holy crap</b>. Someone just ordered 1000 Penny Blossoms.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='↗shut up'>Get out</b>! Who needs 1000 sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>"The fifth annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">Wiki</a>]'>Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender</b> Alliance <b title='a Hawaiian party or celebration'>Luau</b>."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, another market to expand into. Balding gay men.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We should get to work.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait wait wait, why does it say "one-day rush"? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Amazon offers one-day rush.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together. What the hell how are we gonna make 1000 Penny Blossoms in one day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing. I'm just web design.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well I have to call them and cancel that order.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? Yeah, my brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I just don't see how we can <b title='pull off - succeed in doing sth difficult'>pull this off</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, that, right there, that <b title='a way of behaving or speaking that is not clear or definite and is intended to avoid or hide the truth'>equivocation</b> and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit.

<i>Raj</i>You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, stop with the fake third-world crap. Your father's a <b title='↗ob/gyn, obstetrician'>gynecologist</b> and you had a house full of servants.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We only had four servants. And two of them were children.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>No, I don't drink coffee.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. Coffee is out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw. Leonard, help.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah yeah. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership, this enterprise will surely fail.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're right, of course.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Hands him a cup of coffee) Here, this will help.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very well. But if this leads to <b title='opiate - a drug that contains opium ↗poppy, puppy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate">Wiki</a>]'>opiates</b> or <b title='迷幻药 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen">Wiki</a>]'>hallucinogenics</b>, you're going to have to answer to my mother.
