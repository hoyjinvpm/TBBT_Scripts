<i>Sheldon</i>Hold.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Explain your sneeze.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you have allergies?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is there too much pepper on your salad?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't put pepper on salads.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've heard enough. Sit over there.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on. I don't wanna sit by myself.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's what <b title='the first person in the United States identified as an asymptomatic carrier of the pathogen associated with typhoid fever. She was presumed to have infected 53 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook.

<i>Raj</i>Guys, help me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, come on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes) You're on your own.<br>
<i>Howard</i>See you, buddy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. <b title='as per - according to'>Per</b> our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, <b title='Cybernetics is the theory of communication and control based on regulatory feedback. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">Wiki</a>]'>cybernetically</b>-enhanced helper monkeys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sarcasm?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For your information, I'll be <b title='be/play host to sb - receive and entertain sb as a guest'>playing host to</b> Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.<br>
<i>Raj</i>The <b title='cosmology - the science of the origin and structure of the universe'>cosmological</b> physicist from Princeton?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We've been <b title='correspond - exchange letters ↗correspondent'>corresponding</b> for years about our mutual interest in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">Wiki</a>]'>gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe</b>. And now, she's under consideration for a position at our university.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you're a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I've been to Toronto.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine. Where is she gonna sleep?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My room, of course.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Holy crap! (Through napkin) Holy crap!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go ahead.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you <b title='fucking'>freaking</b> kidding me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Bazinga. (Leonard raises his hand) Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. Why is a world-<b title='famous'>renowned</b> scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, she doesn't <b title='like'>care for</b> hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don't open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?<br>
<i>Raj</i>When can I sit with you again?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When I've seen two <b title='following continuously'>consecutive</b> negative throat <b title='culture - group of bacteria grown for medical or scientific study'>cultures</b> spaced 12 hours apart. You know <b title='correct procedure for doing sth'>the drill</b>. All right, if you'll excuse me, I am off to start a <b title='intended to prevent disease'>prophylactic</b> <b title='medical treatment'>course</b> of antibiotics. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't believe he's friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't believe they let him into Canada. (Goes over to the table)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whoa. You heard the man. Where's your throat cultures? (Raj backs off) Kidding. Sit down.<br>

<i>Penny</i>Hey, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these <b title='Maxi / Super – A larger absorbency pad, useful for the start of the menstrual cycle when menstruation is often heaviest [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin">Wiki</a>]'>maxi pads</b>. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing <b title='the use of a lot of advertisements and other publicity to influence or interest people'>hype</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? What are you doing, what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The <b title='a boy or man responsible for replenishing (replenish - fill again) stock, as on the shelves of a grocery store. ↗bellboy, busboy, paperboy'>stock boy</b> at <b title='the largest drug retailing chain in the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walgreens">Wiki</a>]'>Walgreens</b> was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, <b title='a brand of an over-the-counter drug for menstrual cramping [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midol">Wiki</a>]'>Midol</b>, calcium <b title='chew - things can be chewed'>chews</b> and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to <b title='control'>regulate</b> the female bowel.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Why does that seem to <b title='shock'>flabbergast</b> everybody?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not flabbergasted. I'm puzzled. Yeah, let's go with puzzled.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A word of warning. My guest is a <b title='famous'>noted</b> physicist and the leading expert on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cosmology">Wiki</a>]'>quantum cosmology</b>, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female <b title='speech or other use of language that is nonsense, or that appears to be nonsense'>jibber jabber</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Female jibber jabber?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Shoe sales, hair styles, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial">Wiki</a>]'>mud masks</b>, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, they're not my friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
<s>The apartment. Someone knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>She's here, she's here. How do I look? Do I look smart?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='used when you are slightly surprised or annoyed'>good grief</b>. This isn't about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my <b title='↗autobiography, autograph, signature'>biographer</b> might ask you about this event.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then, I remembered that I'd written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn't confuse it with what I'd written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">Wiki</a>]'>neutron star</b>. 'Cause if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Nice to finally meet you in person.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. <b title='used for saying that you think sth that sb has said or done is stupid'>Duh</b>. Uh, it's nice to meet you. I've read both your books and most of your papers. I-I'm Leonard, I live here, you're brilliant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I apologize. He's only an experimental physicist.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I'm sorry, I'm <b title="ramble - wander in one's talk or writing by not keeping to the subject">rambling</b>. Hi-lo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, she's my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent. If <b title='↗constipation, diarrhoea, trot'>the yogurt works</b>, I bought some delightful scented candles.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Picks up a book and points at the cover) Look, it's you.
<s>A little later.</s>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I'm so glad you understand.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, he doesn't understand. I understand.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I understand, too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're just <b title='misappropriate - dishonestly take sth that sb has trusted you with =embezzle'>misappropriating</b> my understanding.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, (<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_a_raspberry">Wiki</a>]'>Blows a raspberry</b>). I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I'm smart.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='be in control of your life'>Get it together</b>, man.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical <b title='liking or inclination'>bent</b>. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Good to know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In here, you'll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then there's really no reason to live, is there?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Can I ask a question about your roommate?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's an odd <b title='sb who says sth really stupid or says sth at the wrong time or place'>duck</b>, isn't he?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>What's his relationship status?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, there was a <b title='badly designed or planned'>misbegotten</b> adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as <b title='inexplicable - incomprehensible, strange'>inexplicably</b> as it began. They had very little in common, except for <b title='sexual activity ↗physical'>carnal activity</b>. That's why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_wipe">Wiki</a>]'>wet wipes</b> you'll find in the bathroom. They're in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. I'll leave you to your night time <b title='the act of washing yourself'>ablutions</b>. I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You'll also find a <b title='covered with a thin layer of plastic for protection'>laminated</b> copy in your welcome packet. It's on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>How thoughtful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sleep well, my friend.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>You too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, let me just get one thing. It's my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn't pass through here. Now, good night. And if there's an <b title='the destruction of the world ↗Armageddon'>apocalypse</b>, good luck.
<s>Leonard's bedroom. There is a knock on the door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I saw your light on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is everything all right?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Me neither. Oh, look what I'm reading. It's you.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I thought you already read it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I did, but it's been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Aw, you're smart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, good. Wasn't sure it was <b title='come across - be understood'>coming across</b>.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>What chapter are you on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, six.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh, the <b title='the succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder">Wiki</a>]'>extragalactic distance ladder</b>. (Sits on his bed) Wanna know a little secret?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I wrote the section on the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%E2%80%93Bappu_effect">Wiki</a>]'>Wilson-Bappu Effect</b> completely naked.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Uh, sure doesn't read that way.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of <b title='The pulsating stars swell and shrink, affecting the brightness and spectrum. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star#Pulsating_variable_stars">Wiki</a>]'>pulsating variable stars</b>, we start to see (Removes her robe) a possible explanation for some of the <b title='discrepancy - difference'>discrepancies</b> found in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Wiki</a>]'>Hubble's constant</b>.

<i>Elizabeth</i>More than pleasant. (Giggles)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Giggles) Excuse me, I'm going to <b title='urinate'>relieve myself</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How do you take your coffee?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Black.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='Okay'>Okeydoke</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(In bathroom) Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Something his mother taught him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been <b title='sanitize - make sth hygienic'>sanitized</b> for your protection.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, so the yogurt didn't work. I'll <b title='quickly send an angry letter to sb'>fire off</b> a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start. I need a ride to work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you once again ignore your check engine light?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, Mr. <b title='sb who wants to appear to be clever'>smarty-pants</b>. I ignored the fill gas tank light.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any <b title='remaining'>residual</b> feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put <b title='his coffee'>this</b> in a travel mug.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn't understand the role gasoline plays in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine">Wiki</a>]'>internal combustion engine</b>.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yes, very much.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wonderful. Meaningless <b title='pleasantry - a friendly remark made in order to be polite'>pleasantries</b> accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Excuse me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It'll be fun. Like a <b title='A common example of such a routine involves an implausibly large number of clowns emerging from a very small car, to humorous effect.

<i>Leonard</i>Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>We just broke up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not as good as you apparently.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I, um, I don't follow.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what? It's, it's none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, now-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's <b title='absurd, outrageous'>preposterous</b>. Tell her, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on. It wasn't my fault.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, I can still drive you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, no, it's okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I must say, I'm shocked by this betrayal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't betray Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not Penny, me!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How am I betraying you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Elizabeth's my friend, and you're playing with her!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I guess I did.
