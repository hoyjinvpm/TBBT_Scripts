<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_(film)">Wiki</a>]'>Hulk</b> movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That is <b title='suitable, appropriate'>apt</b> and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She'll appreciate the <b title='a clever and amusing remark'>witticism</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what's going on with you two?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, the status is as it always was. She's a girl. She's a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes">Air quotes</a>]'>doing this</b>, girlfriend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right, right. So you're still just texting and emailing? You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, you are my best friend. I've known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical <b title='nearness in distance or time'>proximity</b> to Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I sense judgment on your part.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no. Maybe a little.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, right. That.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, <b title='...her supporting role as Alicia Nash in Ron Howard&#039;s 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind. Her later credits include the 2003 Marvel superhero film Hulk where she played Hulk/Bruce Banner&#039;s true love Betty Ross... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly">Wiki</a>]'>Jennifer Connelly</b>, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in <b title='a 2001 American biographical drama film based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)">Wiki</a>]'>A Beautiful Mind</b>, a <b title='intended to make you happy and satisfied'>feel-good</b> <b title='a movie, play, or book that is lively and enjoyable, and not intended to be serious'>romp</b> <b title="Sheldon thinks it's the best movie">if there ever was one</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not jealous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Imitates Hulk) Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there's probably a Sheldon who doesn't believe parallel universes exist.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Probably. What's your point?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No point. It's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm, recently? Not much.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to <b title='the temporary or permanent association formed between a female and male animal during courtship and mating'>pair bond</b> with a woman, and the apparent <b title='of, by or relating to a group or society as a whole'>collective</b> decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, shut up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, when my grandfather died, and <b title="Sheldon's nickname for his maternal grandmother">Meemaw</b> was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a center three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It's very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That sounds lovely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now. I don't need to go to a senior center.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. If I don't meet someone soon, you can put me in a <b title='nursing/retirement home'>home</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not a home. It's a senior center. We'd never put Meemaw in a home!
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, I'll <b title='finally agree to do sth that people want you to do, even though you do not want to do it ↗cave/give in'>bow to</b> social pressure. Hey!<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Phone rings) Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, <b title='The Four Tops are an American vocal quartet [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tops">Wiki</a>]'>Bernadette by The Four Tops</b>. Hello, Bernadette.<br>
<i>Raj</i>When I call him, his phone plays <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Eyed_Girl">Wiki</a>]'>Brown Eyed Girl</b>. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You realize he's just <b title="rub sb's nose in - keep reminding sb sth in an unkind way">rubbing our noses in</b> the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.<br>
<i>Rai</i>You mean, you don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can't even speak to women.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Two words, deaf <b title='young girl/woman'>chick</b>. It doesn't matter if I can't talk, because she can't hear me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's what she said.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend, Sheldon's got a girl-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, no, no!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>who's a friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Con">Wiki</a>] ↗conference'>Comic Con</b>, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual <b title='pick up - successfully attract sb'>pickup</b> <b title='the words spoken by an actor'>line</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Well, good for you.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Not really. She's horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman">Wiki</a>]'>Wonder Woman</b> costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why don't you just break up with her?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No, no, I can't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>'Cause then I'd be alone, like you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, why don't you just invoke your girlfriend <b title='agreement'>pact</b> with Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because, I don't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women's <b title='The first juvenile correctional institution in the United States opened in 1825 in New York City.'>correctional institution</b> with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female <b title='convict - sb who has been proved to be guilty of a crime and sent to prison ↗ex-con, criminal, jail'>convicts</b> to go free.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're saying I couldn't <b title='have sex'>get laid</b> in a women's prison with a handful of <b title='pardon - an official order allowing sb who has been found guilty of a crime to go free without being punished'>pardons</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
<s>The apartment. Leonard is stretched face down on the sofa.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard? Are you sleeping?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you ill?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you still depressed because you're alone, and no one loves you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Maybe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your <b title='general health and happiness'>well-being</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're welcome. But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(On webcam) May I offer an observation?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell? How long has she been here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Since we got home from the comic bookstore.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was two hours ago.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='according to'>As per</b> your suggestion, we're hanging out. Quite frankly, I don't see what all the <b title='excitement about sth which gets a lot of public attention'>hoopla</b>'s about. Go on, Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>From a neurobiological <b title='point of view, perspective'>standpoint</b>, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual <b title='a substance produced by an animal as a chemical signal, to attract another animal of the same species'>pheromone</b>-based stink of desperation.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you know that, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Leonard, I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or <b title='tavern - a pub or an inn'>taverns</b>. Have you tried a bar or tavern?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That's not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your <b title='statement or idea on which reasoning is based'>premise</b>, Leonard could <b title='visit a place often'>frequent</b> sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, (To Leonard) what are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Exiting the apartment) Keep going. I'm listening.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That was rude.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He does it all the time. He's a <b title=' abundant source'>cornucopia</b> of social awkwardness.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Cornucopia. What a <b title='very pleasant to listen to'>mellifluous</b> word.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let's make that our word of the day.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I have to <b title='urinate, pee, relieve oneself'>void my bladder</b>. It was nice spending this time with you.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Wait. I have a request.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'd like you to meet my mother.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see. Can I get back to you on that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Certainly. Good night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good night. (Closing laptop, and running down stairs in panic) Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What does that mean?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you know how you're always saying that Amy is a girl who's your friend, and not your girlfriend?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can't say that anymore.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my <b title='good wishes, approval, support'>blessing</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That is insane.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're right. It would never work. Amy finds you <b title='boring ↗tepid'>tedious</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, good luck.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait! What am I supposed to do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">Wiki</a>]'>hippie</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an <b title='sloping'>inclined</b> plane wrapped <b title='helix - a shape like a spiral [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix">Wiki</a>]'>helically</b> around an axis?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='in trouble or in a bad situation'>Screwed</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='You did it (answered a question in this case) right'>There you go</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy's right. He is tedious.
<s>Outside Howard's house. Leonard rings bell.</s>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Howard, get the door!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why can't you get it?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse for my <b title='examination of the large bowel [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy">Wiki</a>]'>colonoscopy</b>! I'm like an upside-down volcano here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, hey. I hope you didn't hear that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The volcano thing? No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now? (Leonard's wearing a T-shirt with an Apple logo.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's just something I <b title='throw on/off - put on/off hastily or carelessly'>threw on</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know all your shirts. That's not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren't you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don't guard the shirts.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, how'd it go?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wanna invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You that desperate?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Holy <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Wiki</a>]'>Moses</b>, how much liquid can be in one <b title='anus/buttocks'>tukus</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I know what you mean.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend. How do I look?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As if one of the plants from <b title='a 1956 American black-and-white science fiction film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Wiki</a>]'>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</b> duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of <b title='↗mousse, conditioner'>hair gel</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you working on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me and <b title='make, force'>compel</b> me to meet her mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah, you're going <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_the_grid">Wiki</a>]'>off the grid</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Exactly.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The old <b title='an American mathematician and serial murderer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">Wiki</a>]'>Unabomber</b> approach. <b title='congratulations or praise'>Kudos</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What if she just comes over?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She'll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles. (Shows Leonard a metallic "2")<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You changed the address on the building? What about mail?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no worries, I explained my <b title='a difficult or unpleasant situation'>predicament</b> to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(There is a knock on the door) Who is it?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Darn! She found me!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's been here before.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you wanna do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tell her I'm not here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, where are you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know. You'll have to devise a scenario that <b title='plausible - seeming likely to be true, or able to be believed'>plausibly</b> explains my absence, keeping in mind, that the key to a good lie, lies in the details. (Runs to hide)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to tell sb that you are pleased about sth they have done. He KNOWS sarcasm!'>Way to go</b> on the details.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Wiki</a>]'>petri dish</b> of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a <b title='little finger'>pinky</b> swear never to admit we crossed <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease">Wiki</a>]'>Ebola</b> with the common cold.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.<br>
<i>Girl</i>(Arriving) Hi. Sorry I'm late, I was at the gym. <b title='indoor cycling'>Spin class</b>. Worked up quite a sweat.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joy</i>Hi. You don't look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-<br>
<i>Joy</i>Aah! Time's up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I'm hilarious.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?<br>
<i>Joy</i>Yeah. Israeli <b title='a self-defence system developed for the military in Israel [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Wiki</a>]'>Krav Maga</b>. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy's <b title='balls, testicles'>nuts</b> off.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow. Wouldn't think there'd be that many.<br>
<i>Joy</i>Number 42!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Isn't she a <b title='a highly spirited and exceptional person'>pip</b>?
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Rhythmically, while walking down the stairs) Proxima Centauri's the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are: Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, (Jumps down) Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that's wrong! (Heads back up stairs) EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. (Sees Amy standing in lobby) Oh, dear. They really <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> be crazy. (Runs up stairs)
<s>The restaurant.</s>
<i>Joy</i>(Burping) This lobster's good on the way down, and the way up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Should be, it's thirty dollars a pound.<br>
<i>Joy</i>Hey, this is a date, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yep, it is.<br>
<i>Joy</i>73!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa!<br>
<i>Joy</i>Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls' room and take a <b title='very good'>wicked</b> <b title='a session of urination'>whiz</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'll go with you.<br>
<i>Joy</i>Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I think she likes you.
<s>The stairwell. Amy is sitting on the bottom step.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Wearing a heavy coat and false nose and glasses) EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='expression of disappointment, similar to "bummer"'>Rats</b>!<br>
<i>Amy</i>I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No misunderstanding. I've learned what that request actually means, and I don't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.<br>
<i>Amy</i>In what way are you screwed? All I wanna do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So we'd be <b title='perpetrate - commit a crime or do sth wrong or evil'>perpetrating</b> a <b title='trick'>ruse</b>?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Precisely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most <b title='realistic'>pragmatic</b> thing anyone has ever said to me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, please, you're <b title='suffocate - make sb die by preventing them from breathing'>suffocating</b> me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My apologies. Good night, Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Good night, Sheldon.
<s>The restaurant.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she'll <b title='if sb/sth grows on you, you start to like them or it more and more'>grow on</b> you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Seriously? I was once robbed by a <b title='pre-operation'>pre-op</b> transsexual I met on <b title='an online dating service aimed at Jewish singles'>JDate</b>, and that didn't even <b title='break'>crack</b> my top ten.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not that I've ever seen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's relatively new. I just know that I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like simply to have a girlfriend. I'm okay on my own.<br>
<i>Joy</i>Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but-<br>
<i>Joy</i>Yeah, you too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin's wedding.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're asking me out?<br>
<i>Joy</i>Yeah. And it's an <b title='host/open bar - the host pays for all drinks'>open bar</b>, so I'll probably be giving it away.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I look forward to it.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Mrs. Fowler</i>(On webcam) It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn't believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I assure you I am quite real and I'm having regular <b title='sexual intercourse, coitus'>intercourse</b> with your daughter.<br>
<i>Mrs. Fowler</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes. We're like wild animals in heat. It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt.<br>
<i>Mrs. Fowler</i>Amy, what is he saying?<br>
<i>Amy</i>You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina.<br>
<i>Mrs. Fowler</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
