<i>Penny</i>I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these. (Gestures toward her boobs)<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I got a sexy new <b title='a shoulderless, sleeveless women&#039;s garment that wraps around the upper torso [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_top">Wiki</a>]'>tube top</b> that says "Come <b title='here'>hither</b>" and a can of pepper spray that says "Close enough, <b title='a general insult'>Jack</b>."<br>

[Leonard takes a drag on his inhaler of asthma.]<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Isn't every conversation you two have awkward?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So <b title='like'>into</b> her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ready whenever you guys are.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there. Leonard...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, that's nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Quinto">Wiki</a>]'>Zachary Quinto</b> being the new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock">Wiki</a>]'>Spock</b>, but you wound up liking him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>. Every time the topic of change comes up, you <b title='confront sb with a problem/criticism'>throw Zachary Quinto into my face</b>. I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut: Zachary Quinto. I'm upset that <b title='summer time [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">Wiki</a>]'>daylight saving time</b> started: Zachary Quinto. I'm upset daylight saving time ended: Zachary Quinto. I'm saying this for the last time: Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, <b title='used when you are starting to do sth'>here we go</b>. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree, with a face on it that looks a lot like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage">Wiki</a>]'>Nicolas Cage</b>. He says, "Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of <b title='a large number of'>many a</b> <b title='killed in battle with glory'>fallen</b>... hero!"<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As good? You just got <b title="pants - pull down sb's bottom-wear, exposing their underwear. A form of public humiliation">pantsed</b> in the schoolyard, <b title='sb who wears glasses'>four-eyes</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, come on, guys, focus. Oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and <b title='as bad as'>nothing short of</b> death will keep us from our goal. (Phone rings) Oh, Lucy's free <b title='in spite of what has been said, done or expected'>after all</b>. See ya.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave. We just started.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl. Bye.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We'll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a <b title='ghostly'>spectral</b> shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says, "Don't worry, buddies, "Ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest." Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go on, give him your lunch money.
<s>A bar.</s>
<i>Raj</i>I'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Not that it's up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find <b title='the state of being needy'>neediness</b> sexy. In which case, you're about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on <b title='a substance that you put on your skin to stop you from sweating'>antiperspirant</b> all over my body.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Yeah. If sweat starts <b title='if a line of liquid squirts somewhere, it moves somewhere with a lot of force'>squirting</b> out the top of my head, you'll know why.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I, uh, I'm sorry to put you through that.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Oh, it's okay. I've been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What else have you been thinking about doing?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Well, let's see. I'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don't like <b title='short hair that hangs over your forehead =fringe'>bangs</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I like your bangs.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Oh, thanks, I like <b title='them'>'em</b>, too.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What else?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>it's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Mm, yeah. Those are both <b title='difficult questions or problems'>toughies</b>.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>I know. I have a two-year subscription to <b title='a magazine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_%26_Ammo">Wiki</a>]'>Guns & Ammo</b>.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It does.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He does sound effects, too!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. Uh, uh, they attack a nearby <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn">Wiki</a>]'>unicorn</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.<br>
[The girls enter]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Guess who!<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you doing back?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's an excellent question. Amy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Uh, well... when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a <b title='Frisking (also called a patdown or pat down) is a search of a person&#039;s outer clothing wherein a person runs his or her hands along the outer garments to detect any concealed weapons.

I may have broken her nose with my elbow.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Long story short, she's on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a <b title='a pilotless airplane, or unmanned aerial vehicle'>drone</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm sorry. I feel like such an idiot.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, it's not so bad. You lost money, you're filled with shame and you got <b title="move your hands over sb's body to get sexual pleasure">groped</b> by a stranger. I mean, that's Vegas, you <b title='nail - perform a task excellently'>nailed</b> it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You guys enjoy your evening. I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's my girl.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no. Amy, wait. Uh, uh, I know it's not the night you had in mind, but why don't you guys stay and play with us? It'll be fun.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It would- fun? Yeah, okay, three weeks ago, you bought <b title='firm and crisp and making a sharp sound when you bite or crush it'>crunchy</b> peanut butter, but now you want the girls to play D&D, do you have a drug problem?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the big deal? Raj <b title='bail - leave'>bailed</b>, so we <b title='if you say you could use sth, you mean you would really like to have it'>could use</b> some extra players.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, don't worry, sweetie. No one has.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what do you say?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, a... <b title='extremely cruel or evil'>satanic</b> fungus that looks suspiciously like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino">Wiki</a>]'>Al Pacino</b> rises from the forest floor and says, "You're playing D&D. You're playing D&D. This whole apartment...is playing D&D."<br>
[Continued from earlier]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, who wants a drink?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, we- now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. We- it impairs our judgment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, this isn't alcohol. It's a magic potion that makes me like you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Double potion, please.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two <b title='very big and often awkward'>hulking</b> <b title='ogre - cruel and frightening giant who eats people'>ogres</b>. "What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!"<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, <b title='the literal meaning of a word is its most basic meaning'>literal</b> goose bumps. Look.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I draw my broadsword.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I ready my <b title='a long wooden pole that was used as a weapon in the past [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterstaff">Wiki</a>]'>quarterstaff</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I drink my potion.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I say we attack the big one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what? Give me the dice, I wanna roll.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, the dungeon master's supposed to roll.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well I'm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. (Howard hands her the dice) All right, what do I need?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, 15 or higher.<br>
<i>Penny</i>15's the point, the point is 15. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.<br>
<i>Penny</i>More potion, please.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Raj</i>How are your crab <b title='cake - food mixture cooked in a round flat shape'>cakes</b>?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Kind of <b title='having a bad smell or a dirty appearance'>funky</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's great.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>It is? Does "funky" mean something different in India?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, no. Uh, you've always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant; here's your chance.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>It's okay. I just won't eat 'em.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Everything all right?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Uh... yeah. Everything all right with you?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Okay, thanks, bye.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hold on. Isn't there something else you wanted to tell him?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>No, it-it's fine. Uh... He's from a different country, he doesn't understand our ways.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't be silly. Just tell him.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>I have to go to the bathroom. And it's not because the crab cakes are funky.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>So you're okay here?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh, yeah, sorry. She's just a little shy. The-the first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>(Climbed out the bathroom to find the back door is locked) Uh-oh. (Calling him) Hey, Raj. Funny story.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres!<br>
<i>Howard</i>17! The larger ogre is dead! The-the other ogre says, "You killed my brother. Now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, Amy, there's one ogre left. Take him out!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Nineteen! Yes! (Everyone cheers) This is turning out to be even better than Vegas!<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it's not!
<s>An alley behind the restaurant.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Lucy?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Hey, long time no see.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, you don't know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it <b title='if you chip sth, a small piece of it breaks off'>chips</b> away at my masculinity.<br>
<i>Lucy</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why would you leave like that?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>You were pushing me; I clearly didn't wanna send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, if I upset you, then why didn't you just say something?<br>
<i>Lucy</i>Well, how can I tell you I'm upset if I can't tell the woman at <b title='a hair salon franchise with over 2, 000 locations across the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercuts">Wiki</a>]'>Supercuts</b> that my forehead's my best feature? It's scary.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that's scary for me. Mostly because you're a proven <b title='a term most commonly used by lawyers when trying to convince a judge that the defendant might leave the country to avoid punishment if they were let out on bail.

<i>Lucy</i>How could you like me a lot?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman! I don't know. I just... I think you're wonderful. (They kiss through the wire mesh)<br>
<i>Lucy</i>I'm sweating out of my head.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano! (Everyone cheers) But wait! He's not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, uh, wait! Doesn't he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. "You'd think, after all these years, I'd know not to fly over volcanoes. I'm a <b title='fucking"'>freaking</b> idiot."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The dragon's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken">Wiki</a>]'>Christopher Walken</b>! (To Howard) That's perfect.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, Amy, it's your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Here we go. Fifteen?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Wait. And says...<br>
<i>Howard</i>Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I don't know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional <b title='go through the wringer - have a lot of problems and upsetting experiences'>wringer</b> tonight.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>This may be the potion talking, but you are one <b title=''>fine-ass</b> dungeon master.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, they're talking about sex.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, then I'm out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ooh! I have an idea. Since it's not happening anytime soon, why don't your character and your character do it in the game?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>(Makes a funny noise) (To Howard) Come on, back me up here. Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oo... Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that...<br>
<i>Howard</i>The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc">Wiki</a>]'>orc</b> he's ever seen, and he's overcome with a desire to rip her armor off and <b title='stare'>gaze</b> <b title='lovingly'>fondly</b> at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks...well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she's into that. What do you do?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't like this. (Gets up and leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
<s>Sheldon's bedroom. Amy's sitting in the bed.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy. Amy. Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I don't think our relationship is a joke. I think, a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, "why the long face?", that's a joke. It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>. That's an uncomfortable topic. Amy... before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.<br>
<i>Amy</i>And now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And now what?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Do you have any interest now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have not <b title='rule out - exclude'>ruled it out</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Wow. Talk dirty to me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I guess I know that. It's just... part of me wants more.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>More? I mean, look at us. It's only been three years; here we are in bed together.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Come on. Let's go back out there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Y... Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't <b title='finish that'>see that through</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others <b title='rob, steal'>pillage</b> the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armor. (Rolls a dice) It comes off. (Amy gasps) What do you do?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I... kiss you... on the lips.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I kiss you back on the... (Rolls the dice again) lips as well. Your turn.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I... remove your armor. What do you do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I... <b title='erotic - related to sexual desire and pleasure'>erotically</b> <b title='touch sb gently in a way that shows you love them'>caress</b> your... (Rolls the dice again) nose.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Keep rolling.<br>
[Continued from earlier. Penny and Leonard are at the door. Leonard knocks on the door.]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We're fine, thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about...<br>
