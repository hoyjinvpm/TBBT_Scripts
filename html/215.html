<i>Raj</i>I don't ever wanna feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love / Take me all the way / I don't wanna feel (Penny enters without being noticed) / Like I did that day / Take me to place I love (Sees Penny and stops)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fellas, please. (Motions them to turn it down)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Honey, come on. We were just finding our sound.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You found it. It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Appears, on phone) I'm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course, but, uh, you understand my <b title='anxiety, fear, nervousness'>trepidation</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's that about?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not a clue.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can't we just postpone it till this spring? Maybe next summer?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This should be fairly easy to deduce. He's holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres. So he's using the analytical, rather than emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure. I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's referring to an activity he has done before. It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a <b title='-scopy - viewing, seeing, observation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy">Wiki</a>]'>colonoscopy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aren't there any other options? There's not a lot of room. It's gonna be uncomfortable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, yes. I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, bye. My mother's coming to visit.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Sheldon) How about that? You were right.
<s>The staircase. A woman is waiting for the elevator when Penny passes by, carrying her laundry.</s>
<i>Penny</i>It's out of order.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Yes, I can read the sign. I'm just <b title='ponder - consider'>pondering</b> the implications.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and tape are covered with a layer of dust which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time, which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density, or a shared delusion of functionality.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You must be Leonard's mother.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, I'm Penny, I'm his neighbor.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, nice to meet you. (Reaches out her hand)<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting. (They shake hands)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, why don't you come with me, I'll walk you to the apartment.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange <b title='pleasantry - things that you say to sb in order to be polite, but which are not very important'>pleasantries</b> on the way?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, sure, I guess.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>All right, you start.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok. You know I've always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, I think you mean young. He's always been <b title='not tall'>little</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right. Ok, what was he like when he was young?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>You'll have to be more specific.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, um, okay, like five or six. (Dr. Hofstadter stares at her) Five.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, well, at that age, he was <b title='enmesh - entangle, involve, or catch in'>enmeshed</b> in what Freud would call the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallic_stage">Wiki</a>]'>phallic stage of psychosexual development</b>. An <b title='outdated'>outmoded</b> theory, of course. But the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Well, that is one of my <b title='degree - academic title, rank or grade'>degrees</b>. My primary field is neuroscience.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Well, I'm an actress. (Giggles)<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>(Stares at her for a while) Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ha. What-what do you mean, why?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>There were studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I don't know what that means.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Tell me about it.<br>
(After a while)<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Sobbing) I know my dad wanted a boy. I- I just- I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>And then, I'm assuming you entered adolescence.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh-huh. He called me <b title='a baseball player who hits the ball a very long way'>slugger</b> until I got my first <b title='a bra designed for girls who have begun to develop breasts during early puberty. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_bra">Wiki</a>]'>training bra</b> and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn't slugger anymore. (Knocks on Leonard's door) Your mother's here.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what cologne her father wore. [<a target=_blank href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_complex  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_complex%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_complex">Electra complex</a>]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good to see you, mother.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Here's your tea, mother.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong">Wiki</a>]'>Oolong</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Loose, not bagged?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i><b title='steep - soak thoroughly'>Steeped</b> three minutes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Two-percent milk?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Warmed separately?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>One teaspoon sugar?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raw sugar?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>It's cold. (Tastes it)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll start again.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus <b title='stem from - develop as a result of sth elese'>stems from</b> an over-developed <b title='the feeling of wanting or needing to have sex'>sex drive</b>.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, I don't know where he would've gotten that. Aside from a <b title='done because it is part of the usual way of doing sth, although it has no real meaning'>pro forma</b> <b title='when people make a marriage or relationship complete by having sex'>consummation</b> of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Yes, we think so. We've both done papers on it. Mine from a neuroscientific point of view and his from an <b title='anthropology - the scientific study of people, their societies, cultures etc'>anthropological</b>. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Well, it's all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Here's your tea, mother. So, what are you guys talking about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='great'>Swell</b>. If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation. (Sheldon is intrigued)<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop. (He groans in disappointment)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, mother, what's new?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>You'll have to be more specific.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right. Uh, what's new with you?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, well, I've been having some <b title='extremely interesting'>fascinating</b> <b title='Menopause is the cessation of a woman&#039;s reproductive ability, the opposite of menarche. Menopause is usually a natural change; it typically occurs in women in midlife, during their late 40s or early 50s, signalling the end of the fertile phase of a woman&#039;s life. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause">Wiki</a>]'>menopausal symptoms</b> recently.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe something less personal?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh. Your uncle Floyd died.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, my God. What happened?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate. (Goes to the bathroom)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What a remarkable woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I- I thought you guys might <b title='have a good friendly relationship'>hit it off</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I envy you your childhood.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my uncle Floyd.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful. And I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat <b title='a green vegetable like a very small cabbage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout">Wiki</a>]'>Brussels sprouts</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough <b title='praise, approval, recognition'>credit</b>. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potty_training">Wiki</a>]'>potty training</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an <b title='the recording of electrical activity along the scalp [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEG">Wiki</a>]'>EEG</b>, I had to attach my own electrodes.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Please don't go there, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, I understand that unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Boy, you suck.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Well, Leonard's younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard and his sister just successfully grew a human <b title='an organ in the body that produces insulin'>pancreas</b> in an adolescent <b title='an ape with very long arms'>gibbon</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So she's close to curing diabetes?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow, you must be very proud.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Why? They're not my accomplishments. I have to urinate. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why are you doing this?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know the rules. You brought your mom to work. You must suffer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, you're like the <b title='a fictional character from Star Wars [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks">Wiki</a>]'>Jar Jar Binks</b> of the Hofstadter family.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, meesa think yousa looking so, so sad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize this is difficult and try to help me through it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day? (Dr. Hofstadter returns)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was fast.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I'll have to try again later.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's totally understandable. In bladder <b title="void - empty the contents of one's bowels or bladder">voiding</b>, as in real estate, it's location, location, location.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>So where were we?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, that's fascinating. Selective <b title='the condition of being unable or unwilling to speak as a result of a physical or psychological disorder ↗mute'>mutism</b> is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common, it borders on sociological cliché.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's just temporary. I pay rent.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He lives in the same room where his <b title='a bed for a baby, shaped or woven like a basket'>bassinet</b> was.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one's mother can stem from a <b title='unreasonable, irrational'>pathological</b> fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an <b title='fake, artificial'>ersatz</b> homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.<br>
(The two are stunned, and Lenoard smirks)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Say what? (Raj whispers something in his ear) That's basically what I just said.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, <b title='you bet - certainly'>betcha</b>, betcha.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Leonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, there's no hurry, mother. Tell them more about their secret love for each other.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>But it's 1:00. You were going to show me your laboratory at 1:00.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Her reasoning is <b title='not able to be criticized, made weaker, or beaten ↗assail, attack'>unassailable</b>. It is 1:00. (Points at his watch)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. Let's go. I think you'll find my work pretty interesting. I'm attempting to replicate the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">Wiki</a>]'>dark matter</b> signal found in sodium-<b title='↗iodine'>iodide</b> crystals by the Italians.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>So no original research?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>What's the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote. (They leave)<br>
<i>Howard</i>(to Sheldon) Just for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, then, why didn't you say that to her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why is it always my responsibility?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I can't believe you're <b title='bring up - mention'>bringing that up</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I didn't bring it up. You did.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We'll talk about this later. (Signal him that they're not alone)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, you always say that, but we never do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You went to the comic book store without me.
<s>The hallway. Leonard knocks at Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You got alcohol?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Your mom still here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yep.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on in. Wait-wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh my God. What happened?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Jeez, what a fun couple.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ugh. She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I've been half <b title='destroyed'>bombed</b> ever since.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can't let her get into your head.<br>
<i>Penny</i>My head, what about yours?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's too late for me. My head is her summer house.<br>
<i>Penny</i>She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, mom.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid <b title='a drug used to treat depression'>antidepressant</b> commercial. And for what? So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did you get the <b title='role'>part</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, they said I was too <b title='confident, happy, and active'>perky</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna talk about not getting love from a parent? You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let it go. Your mother told me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course she did. That's not what I was gonna say. Uh, when I was 10 years old, I built a hugging machine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>A hugging machine?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. I got a <b title='↗tailor'>dressmaker</b>'s <b title='model'>mannequin</b>, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it'd be warm and I built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that is so sad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Know what the saddest part was?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My father used to borrow it.
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Your scan data will be very helpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. Although I've always hated how my right frontal <b title='a round part of an organ in your body'>lobe</b> looks in pictures.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Common complaint among men. Nothing's ever big enough. Except when they get a tumor. Then you never hear the end of it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Oh, I'll send you a link, but its <b title='the way the body of a person or an animal works'>physiology</b> is fairly unimpressive.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I can't believe that.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Your unwillingness to accept <b title='relying on practical experience rather than theories'>empirical</b> evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My apologies. I've been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Understandable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can I make you a cup of tea?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I feel very comfortable around you.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>I feel very comfortable around you too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's surprising because I generally don't feel comfortable around- Well, anyone.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Nor I.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively <b title='ordinary and not interesting =everyday'>workaday</b> as your son?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Is that a <b title='asked only to make a statement or to produce an effect rather than to get an answer'>rhetorical</b> point or would you like to do the math?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'd like to do the math.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>I'd like that too.
<s>Penny's apartment. Penny and Leonard are drinking.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Mm. Oh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Heh-heh-heh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, now this time-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're gonna lick the salt... off my neck (Scatters salt on her neck) do the <b title='a small amount of a drink'>shot</b>. Whoops. And then, bite the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_%28fruit%29">Wiki</a>]'>lime</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after "lick."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Neck. Shot. Lime. (Leonard licks her neck) Okay, shot, lime.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Dah! Where's the lime? (Penny shows that It's in her mouth) Okay, we're sharing. (They kiss. Leonard get the lime and spit it away)
<s>Leonard's apartment. Dr. Hofstadter and Sheldon are sitting on the couch.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, what do you think?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>I'm very tempted. I'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Normally, I'd feel the same way. But based on everything I've observed about us, I can't help but <b title='guess'>speculate</b> we'd be very good together.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>True. I've had a similar observation. It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of <b title='内啡肽 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins">Wiki</a>]'>endorphins</b>. It's quite satisfying.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Mm. I see what you're doing. You're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You see right through me, don't you?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Only when you're in a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography">Wiki</a>]'>CAT</b> scanner. (Snorts then laughs)
<s>Penny's bedroom. She and Leonard are in bed.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>This is actually gonna happen.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Honey. Shush, shush, shush.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You shush. I'm happy. I wanna talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of <b title='make up for - compensate'>making up for</b> intimacy we didn't get as children.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Upset) Why would you bring that up right now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Foreplay?<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, you're saying you're not having sex with me, you're having sex with your mother?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, I'm gonna go with no.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That is the sickest thing I have ever heard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, come on, you're trying to have sex with your father, and I'm okay with that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get out!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Thrown out of her apartment and without pants on) She said shush. I should have shushed.<br>
[Cut to his apartment. dr. hofstadter and sheldon are singing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Way_You_Want_It">Wiki</a>]'>Journey's "Any Way You Want It"</b>.]<br>
Oh all night / Oh all night / all night / all night / Oh, every night / every night / Hold tight / Hold tight / Hold tight / Baby, hold tight / Anyway you want it / That's the way you need it<br>
[Time lapse. The hallway. Dr. Hofstadter's leaving.]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, mother. Um, have a nice flight.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>That's not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes. (Awkwardly lets him hug her. After a while, pats him on the head and pushes him away. Penny appears.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, good morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Morning.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, I was just coming over to talk to you-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You don't have to. Ever.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='I understand'>Gotcha</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Goodbye, mother.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Goodbye, Leonard. (To Penny) So, slugger, shall we <b title='start again, continue'>pick up</b> where we left off last time?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Sobbing) I mean, my mom could've just said, "Bob, <b title='overcome'>get over</b> it, she's a girl, move on." But she didn't. Not one word.<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Would it help?<br>
<i>Dr. Hofstadter</i>Well, it would help me.
