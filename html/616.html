<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>You'll never believe what happened to me at work today.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm?<br>
<i>Penny</i>This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding. Did you <b title="series of abdominal thrusts under the diaphragm, named after Henry Heimlich [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimlich_Maneuver'>Wiki</a>]">Heimlich</b> him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking, and then one of the <b title="busboy - a boy or man who removes dirty dishes from the tables in a restaurant">busboys</b> Heimlich'ed him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're a hero.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that was the point of the story.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, I think so. Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you mean, why? It's Valentine's Day.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You could be a little more <b title="be enthusiastic about">into</b> it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I'm into it, I'm into it. Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, this time it's going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don't see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, sometimes I think I've made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I <b title="agree">concur</b>, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine's Day?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, you caught that, did you?
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Howard</i>(On phone) Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Everything okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernie's a little cranky since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been <b title="bust one's butt/ass - work very hard">busting my tail</b> playing <b title="a historical fiction action-adventure open world stealth video game series [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed'>Wiki</a>]">Assassin's Creed</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine's Day?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and <b title="describes an experience or activity that makes you feel very frightened and often excited">white-knuckling</b> it till morning. What do you got going on?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, well, I was gonna spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, <b title="his dog">she</b> got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>There must be something we can do.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don't have dates?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>That actually sounds kinda nice.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>That's good. Or maybe something go a little less hand in the pants.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.<br>
<i>Alex</i>Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I've been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no, no. That's not gonna happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Alex</i>You realize I <b title="pass up - reject">passed up</b> an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I guess those <b title="chap - man ↗lad, lass, laddie, lassie">chaps</b> will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let's see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the color grey. (After she leaves) Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.
<s>Howard's lab.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you coming to lunch?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, one second. Come here. I wanna show you something.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What you looking at?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I was trying to <b title="think of, suggest">come up with</b> something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine's Day since she's been such <b title="very annoying or irritating">a pain in the ass</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can't find a card that says that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, that's cool.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Mmm, about twelve hours. I <b title="pull an all-nighter - finish a task in an all-night period of awakedness">pulled an all-nighter</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, wow.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm gonna take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of- (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wanna come to dinner with us?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, please.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine's gift, so, you're up kid. <b title="impress sb a lot">Dazzle</b> me. Go.<br>
<i>Alex</i>Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy's Facebook page and <b title="study/learn by reading">read up on</b> her interests.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, see, I never would've thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice <b title="farm out - send work etc from a central point to be done elsewhere">farming this out</b> to you. But <b title="used for emphasis">I am telling you</b>, Amy hit the boyfriend <b title="a large amount of money that sb wins in a card game">jackpot</b>. Anyway, my socks are on. Let's <b title="knock sb's sock off - surprise and please sb by being very impressive">knock them off</b>.<br>
<i>Alex</i>Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so, I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to <b title="perform a displeasing action">pull</b> here?<br>
<i>Alex</i>No, I just thought it would be-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Next.<br>
<i>Alex</i>Okay. Um, I know she's a fan of <b title="a collection of over 20 stories written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer at the end of the 14th century [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales'>Wiki</a>] <a href="408.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/tbbt/408.html">You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yayeh meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.</a>">The Canterbury Tales</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mmm.<br>
<i>Alex</i>So, I found this cool map that illustrates the character's journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But she's got Google Maps on her phone.<br>
<i>Alex</i>I don't know how to respond to that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I hope it's with a third good option, because these first two, buh.<br>
<i>Alex</i>Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy's a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramony Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.<br>
<i>Alex</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think I'll keep it for myself.<br>
<i>Alex</i>What about your girlfriend?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's too late. I <b title="claim rights">call dibs</b>.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Penny</i>This place is really beautiful.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Waugh, romance ninja.<br>
(Bernadette and Howard enter)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sorry we're late.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No problem. We just sat down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mmm, would you like some wine?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, fill her up. (Leonard stops pouring) I'll tell you when to stop.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is everything okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Terrific. Couldn't be better.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, <b title='go to hell'>bite me</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Maybe if you did what you said you were gonna do, I'd tell you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, where what is?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She hid my Xbox like I'm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm <b title="tell on - inform sb about sth bad or wrong that sb else has done">telling</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I've been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I said I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I told you, turn them inside out.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>And I told you to bite me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Trying to have a magical night here, guys.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, <b title="used to express annoyance, disgust, disappointment, or amazement">son of a bitch</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nothing. Nothing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, tell me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's just this guy I used to date.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who's here with him now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know it's not ideal, but don't let them ruin our night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you're totally right. She could be skinny 'cause she's dying.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's the spirit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what, screw them. Our night is gonna be way more special than theirs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Uh-oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? (Penny's ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you gotta be kidding me.<br>
<i>Gretchen</i>Oh, my God, yes. Of course I'll marry you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title="↗a 2001 romantic comedy film [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Can_Play_That_Game'>Wiki</a>]">Two can play this game</b>. Penny-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right.
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Raj</i>It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Except on a date with anybody.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Literally anybody.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, yeah, think about it. We'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies. It'd be like the best relationship ever.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>That does sound nice.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just <b title="pile driver - a large machine that pushes posts into the ground to support new buildings [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pile_driver'>Wiki</a>]">pile-drive</b> you into <b title="state of being unaware or unconscious">oblivion</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>What?
<s>The restaurant.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I can't believe he's gonna marry the girl he cheated on me with.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Isn't it kinda nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What, so I'm the wrong person? Maybe you wanna be with Gretchen, too.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>They do look happy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, absolutely. Now they're doing that <b title="not sincere/real">phony</b> link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought we were letting it go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We were; it's just, it's not fair, okay? They're bad people. It's not supposed to end happy for them, it's supposed to end happy for me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, it did end happy for you. You're here with me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, yeah, I know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, don't make this about you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm not. It's about you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This one does, and you're the reason why.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>(To Howard) You know, compared to them, I'm feeling pretty good about us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Me too. How about we <b title="ignore, skip">blow off</b> dessert, go home early, I'll do that laundry.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I love you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Love you, too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So where'd you hide it?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Where you'd never look.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Damn it, it's in the washing machine.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Happy Valentine's Day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Shall we go to dinner?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I've been working on this facial expression all day.<br>
<i>Amy</i>And I appreciate your effort, but upon <b title="contemplate - consider, ponder, meditate">contemplation</b>, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your <b title="much loved">beloved</b> Star War Trek things.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>More than anything.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, then, that's what we're gonna do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I don't know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me. And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm your girlfriend. That's my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so, whatever you got me, you can return.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What's this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Read it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>At the bottom.<br>
<i>Amy</i>In case of emergency, please contact- Amy Farrah Fowler. And there's my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I wanna share that with?<br>
<i>Amy</i>And you picked me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, Sheldon. (Hugs him)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it's like you-you <b title="go out of one's way - make an effort to do sth">went out of your way</b> to destroy it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I know. I'm a total bitch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not saying that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I am.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine, you win. You're a bitch. Why couldn't we just have a nice time?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately and I've been really happy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Obviously, I have some commitment issues.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Glaringly obvious. Go on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>As long as things keep going great between us, you'll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes, and then we're gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. I know I propose a lot. So, how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you wanna get married, you have to propose to me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. It's all on you. But I gotta tell you, when the time comes, I want the <b title="everything">whole nine yards</b>. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I wanna <b title="sweep one off (one's) feet - impress deeply">be swept off my feet</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you got it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And I'm cool with surprises. But nothing on a <b title="a large-screen television [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbotron'>Wiki</a>]">Jumbotron</b>. I don't wanna cry on a big screen like that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You do?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard Hofstadter?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Will you be my <b title="sb you love or would like to have a romantic relationship with, to whom you send a valentine card">valentine</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry. Maybe next year. I'm just kidding. Romance ninja. Let's have sex. Waugh!
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Nerdy guy</i>Thank you, guys, for doing this.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We're glad you could make it.<br>
<i>Nerdy guy</i>Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone. This year, I'm just sad.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight's the night I know everyone else does, too.<br>
<i>Nerdy guy</i>I think you're cool.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Great.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I gotta tell you, we've gotta stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn't make us <b title="mutant - a plant or animal that is different from others of its type as a result of a change in its genes">mutants</b>. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We gotta stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let's give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.<br>
<i>Girl</i>That was cool. What you said.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You really think so?<br>
<i>Girl</i>Yeah, I do.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee?<br>
<i>Girl</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Later, losers!

I seriously doubt he was bitten by a <b title="虎紋捕鳥蛛 [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_bird_spider'>Wiki</a>]">Chinese bird spider</b>. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumor that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumor. I'm on my way. (Hangs up) Brain tumor would explain a lot.
