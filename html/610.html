<i>Sheldon</i>Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would it trouble you? It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do <b title="a French-Canadian-American animated television series [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget'>Wiki</a>]">Inspector Gadget</b>, and <b title="TMNT [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles'>Wiki</a>]">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</b>, heroes in a half-shell.<br>
<i>Howard & Raj</i>Turtle power!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>However, the Spider-Man lyrics <b title="assume the existence of; postulate">posit</b> that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave <b title="a country in Central America [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala'>Wiki</a>]">Guatemala</b> without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's <b title="a feeling of anxiety, apprehension, depression or illness">heebie-jeebies</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I know, but that sounds <b title="hating Jewish people">anti-Semitic</b>. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their <b title="A media franchise is the licensing of intellectual property (IP) from an original work of media (usually a work of fiction), such as a film, a work of literature, a television program or a video game, to other parties or partners for commercial exploitation.

<i>Leonard</i>Penny's working tonight, I'm in.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not me. I'm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fun. We know how much you love that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, you know, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks, Sheldon. I'll try that with my father-in-law.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, you can't use that one. That's mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular <b title="knowledge and traditions">lore</b>, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Great, thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, you can't have that one either. It's too good. Sorry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me to a <b title="↗<a href='/afs/917.html'>9/7: The Memorial Service</a>">memorial service</b>. It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so, my planned conversational <b title="opening moves in chess; a remark which you make to sbne in order to start or continue a conversation">gambit</b> is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That should lighten the mood.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.

<i>Sheldon</i>Amy. Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Solemnly) Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hello, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not allowed to wear my <b title="a fictional character, a superhero appearing in comic books and other publications by Marvel Comics. [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer'>Wiki</a>]">Silver Surfer</b> neck tie, you can wear a bathrobe?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Me? No. I'm not that kind of doctor.<br>
<i>Amy</i>But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill. When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy. Amy. Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your <b title="health and happiness">well-being</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Thank you, Sheldon.<br>

<i>Howard</i>So, how have you been?<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>It's fine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How's that dinner coming?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I like rare chicken. Let's do this.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You could die.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Death by chicken. That's a pretty <b title="↗foul">fowl</b> way to go.<br>
<i>Mrs. Rostenkowski</i>Here's another beer, honey.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?<br>
<i>Mrs. Rostenkowski</i>It was good.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To his father-in-law) Had no idea you were the chatty one.

<i>Sheldon</i><b title="39 °C">102.2</b>. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. Like I'm trying to get better.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, you don't <b title="recover from">get over</b> the flu in half an hour.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, not with that attitude.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little <b title="be unable to do what is necessary or expected">lacking</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the <b title="a harmless substance given to a sick person instead of medicine, without telling them it is not real">placebo</b> effect?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its <b title="the state of being logical and true">validity</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great. Now, this may look like a <b title="a brand of small, hard mints [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_Tac'>Wiki</a>]">Tic Tac</b>, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, this isn't helping. Why don't you just let me get some rest.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How can you sleep? I'm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold <b title="a piece of cloth">rag</b> on your head, sing to you and apply <b title="a mentholated topical cream [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicks_VapoRub'>Wiki</a>]">VapoRub</b> to your chest.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Intrigured, gets up, in trembling voice) You, you wanna rub something on my chest?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. All over it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Maybe we should start with that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now you're being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some <b title="if a part of your body tingles, you feel a slight stinging feeling, especially on your skin; feel excitement, fear etc very strongly">tingling</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, I'm <b title="count on - expect; rely/depend on">counting on</b> it. Ohhh. Hmm.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, <b title="eat">dig in</b>.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these <b title="your">thy</b> gifts which we are about to receive from thy <b title="generous actions">bounty</b> through Christ our Lord. Amen.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title="You said exactly what I meant to say before I had a chance to say it">Took the words right out of my mouth</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>I'm going next weekend.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you like to fish?<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure. I can hear it in your voice.<br>
<i>Mrs. Rostenkowski</i>Oh, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, I hadn't thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no. We know each other well enough. He's been talking my ear off all night.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie, I think you'd have fun.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>Fine, you can <b title="go somewhere with sb, esp when they have not asked you to go with them">tag along</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Terrific. Two favorite fellas gone fishing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What thing?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, the thing.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>All right, it's settled. You and I are going fishing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.

<i>Howard</i>I've never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh. If you don't want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many <b title="Beef Wellington is a preparation of filet steak coated with pâté and duxelles, which is then wrapped in puff pastry and baked. [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Wellington'>Wiki</a>]">Beef Wellingtons</b> I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I'll give you a hint. (Points at his belly, hip, and ass) You can see them here, here and here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some <b title="pointer - advice =tip">pointers</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do either of you guys know how to fish?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.

<i>Penny</i>S'up?

<i>Penny</i>Step one, worms.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ew!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you're not gonna wanna say in front of your father-in-law. It's right up there with <b title="very unpleasant, especially to look at, taste, or feel =yucky">icky</b> and get it away. Now pick one up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you waiting for?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. There.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm no expert, but I-I think the hook has to go through the worm.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, don't name him. Just <b title="push a pointed object into sb/sth">jab</b> a hook in his face.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You got this, buddy.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>How's the poor thing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for <b title="a part of your body that is congested is very full of liquid, usually blood or mucus">congestion</b>, but there's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, I'm gonna <b title="take or pull liquid or gas from somewhere, run">draw</b> you a soothing bath. Where's your bath thermometer?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't have a bath thermometer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-<b title="wrack/rack - cause physical or mental pain">wracking</b> bath of <b title="indefinite">indeterminate</b> temperature.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>This is a really good <b title="a type of medicine that you take to help you cough up phlegm from your lungs ↗laxative">expectorant</b>. Although some test subjects reported <b title="lactate - produce milk from the breasts">lactating</b> uncontrollably when they heard music.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Okay, okay, <b title="used to describe a situation or 'what is happining'">here's the deal</b>. I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I got better two days ago. It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>I don't mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right. I'll tell him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Off) Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.

<i>Penny</i>Now, let's assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You're gonna have to know how to <b title="take the guts out of">gut</b> it. So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I'm fine. Keep going.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. Now, you don't wanna cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What, never?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My dad was an <b title="anthropology - the study of the human race">anthropologist</b>. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruria'>Wiki</a>]">Etruscan</b> boy. I hated that kid.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, okay, Howard wins.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, maybe we didn't have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're right. Oh! I should do this.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Great. Here you go. What you're gonna do is you're gonna stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Here we go. Oh!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, look, it's a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)

<i>Amy</i>Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back. <b title="take a turn for the worse - start to get worse">Taking a turn for the worst</b>. I think I'm gonna need another bath.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek <b title="a small amount of a substance that is taken from sb's body with a swab in order to test it">swab</b> and had it <b title="culture - grow bacteria or cells for medical or scientific use">cultured</b> in the lab.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio'>Pinocchio</a>]">A growing nose</b>, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as <b title="in its most complete and developed form">full-blown</b> liar, liar, pants on fire.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It's just been so nice having you take care of me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that <b title="skew - move or lie at an angle">skews</b> in my favor.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I feel terrible I did this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is <b title="suitable">in order</b>, so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_prison'>Wiki</a>]">stockade</b> in the public square. That probably requires a permit.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn't kill a man. You know, it's <b title="sligthly">a tad</b> <b title="old-fashioned">old-school</b>, but my father was not one to <b title="spare the rod and spoil the child - you should punish a child when he or she misbehaves">spare the rod</b> when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you saying you wanna spank me?<br>

<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>Maybe in cartoons.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.<br>

<i>Howard</i>Wait, now we're shooting things?<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>I like using a big shell. You can't eat them afterwards, but it's fun watching them blow up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sir, I'm flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don't think this trip is the way to do it. And I can't return these things if there's chunks of duck all over them.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>So, why'd you agree to come?<br>
<i>Howard</i>'Cause Bernadette made me.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You're a big, scary cop.<br>
<i>Mr. Rostenkowski</i>You're an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she's only four feet tall.<br>
