<i>Raj</i>Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball">Wiki</a>]'>paintball</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That was absolutely humilating.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, but you don't have to lose to <b title='[<a href="http://wiki.the-big-bang-theory.com/wiki/Bernstein,_Kyle">Wiki</a>]'>Kyle Bernstein's</b> <b title='Jewish boy who has reached the age of 13'>bar mitzvah</b> party.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think we have to acknowledge, those was some fairly savage <b title='generally designated as 10–13 years [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preadolescent">Wiki</a>]'>preadolescent</b> jews.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we were <b title='annihilate - destroy completely'>annihilated</b> by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, let it go!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I shot you for good reason. You were leading us into disaster.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was giving clear, concise orders.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You hid behind a tree yelling, "<b title='hurt/kill'>Get</b> the kid in the <b title='a hemispherical or platter-shaped cap [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarmulke">Wiki</a>]'>yarmulke</b>! Get the kid in the yarmulke!"<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, Penny.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hello. Morning, <b title='used as a polite form of address to a woman'>ma'am</b>. (Salutes)<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, how was paintball? Did you have fun?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sure, if you consider being <b title='In the United States military, fragging (from fragmentation grenade) refers to the act of murdering members of the military, particularly commanders of a fighting squad.'>fragged</b> by your own troops fun. You clear space on your calendar, there will be an <b title='an official process to find out about sth'>inquiry</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Um, hey, I'm having a party on Saturday, so if you guys are around, you should come by.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A party?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A... "boy-girl" party?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party, so... It'll just be a bunch of my friends. We'll have some beer, do a little dancing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dancing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I don't know, Penny...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The thing is, we're not...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, we're really more of a...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But thanks. Thanks for thinking of us.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A Halloween party?<br>
<i>Howard</i>As in... costumes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah.<br>
[The boys exchanges glances]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is there a theme?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, yeah, Halloween.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre-specific?<br>
<i>Penny</i>As usual, I'm not following.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction, fantasy...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What about comic books?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='a type of Japanese animated movie that often shows a lot of violence or sex'>Anime</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>TV, film, <b title='Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%26D">Wiki</a>]'>D&D</b>, <b title='Japanese comic books or cartoons with stories that often contain a lot of sex and violence'>manga</b>, Greek gods, Roman gods, <b title='relating to Scandinavian countries in medieval times'>Norse</b> gods-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Anything you want! Okay? (Playfully strokes him on the cheek) Any costume you want. (Starts to leave) Bye.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
<s>The living room. Someone knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Wearing a <b title='a superhero in comic books from DC [<a href="http://wiki.the-big-bang-theory.com/wiki/Flash">Wiki</a>]'>Flash</b> costume) I'll get it.<br>
[Howard, wearing the same Flash costume, dashes into the room]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no. (He is wearing the same Flash costume too)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Make way for the fastest man alive! (in the same costume) Oh, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We all have other costumes: We can change.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Or we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this flash runs solo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, how about this? Nobody gets to be The Flash. We all change. Agreed?<br>
<i>All</i>Agreed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I <b title='claim ownership etc'>call</b> <b title='Frodo Baggins is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#039;s legendarium. He serves as the primary protagonist of The Lord of the Rings. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frodo">Wiki</a>]'>Frodo</b>! (Runs off)<br>
<i>All</i>Damn!
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You went with <b title='In Norse mythology, Thor is a hammer-wielding god [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor">Wiki</a>]'>Thor</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What, just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse god? "No, no, Raj has to be an Indian god." That's racism. I mean look at Wolowitz. He's not English, but he's dressed like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan">Wiki</a>]'>Peter Pan</b>. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously <b title='the change in frequency of a wave (or other periodic event) for an observer moving relative to its source. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">Wiki</a>]'>the Doppler effect</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not Peter Pan. I'm <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood">Wiki</a>]'>Robin Hood</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? Because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like <b title='To her surprise, she discovered she could not only pull off playing Peter Pan, but that she actually enjoyed doing it. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Rigby">Wiki</a>]'>Cathy Rigby</b>. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Sheldon, there's something I wanna talk to you about before we go to the party.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's not that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I have to, I can demonstrate. (It is commonly heard when a vehicle sounding a siren or horn approaches, passes, and recedes from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For example, tonight, no one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But there's nothing embarrassing about that. Your father worked with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Leakey">Wiki</a>]'>Louis Leakey</b>, a great <b title='anthropology - the scientific study of people, their societies, cultures etc'>anthropologist</b>. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her <b title='your peers are the people who are the same age as you, or who have the same type of job, social class etc'>peer</b> group, a potential close friend, and perhaps more, and I don't want to look like a <b title='a stupid awkward person'>dork</b>. (Looks into the mirror and fixes his fake ears)
<s>The hallway. Howard knocks at Penny's door.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Just a <b title='wanring'>heads up</b>, fellas. If anyone gets lucky, I've got a dozen condoms in my <b title='a long case for carrying arrows'>quiver</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey. Sorry we're late.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Late? It's 7:05.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you said the party starts at 7:00.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7:00, no one shows up at, you know, 7:00.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's 7:05.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes. Yes, it is. Okay. Well, um, come on in.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, what, are all the girls in the bathroom?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Probably, but in their own homes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, what time does the costume parade start?<br>
<i>Penny</i>The parade?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume. You know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visualization of a scientific principal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry, but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This party is just going to <b title='be very bad'>suck</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No! Come on, it's gonna be fun, and you all look great. I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan. That's so cute.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, Penny, he's Robin Hood.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm Peter Pan. And I got a handful of <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/The_Pirate_Fairy_poster.jpg/220px-The_Pirate_Fairy_poster.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Fairy">Wiki</a>]'>pixie dust</b> with your name on it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you don't. Uh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, he's the Doppler effect.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sure, I see it now. The Doppler effect. All right, I gotta shower. You guys, um, make yourselves comfortable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See? People get it.<br>
(The guys sit on the couch. Time lapses. The party is ongoing.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>By <b title='a major god in most if not all branches of Germanic mythology especially in the Norse mythology branch of Germanic mythology [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Wiki</a>]'>Odin</b>'s beard, this is good <b title='a type of snack mix that includes Chex breakfast cereal (sold by General Mills) as a major component. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chex_Mix">Wiki</a>]'>Chex Mix</b>. (Offers Howard it)<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, thanks. Peanuts. I can't afford to <b title='↗allergic'>swell up</b> in these tights.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're socializing, meeting new people.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='telepathy - mind-to-mind communicating'>Telepathically</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To some girl) Oh, hey, when did you get here? Hi.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Penny is wearing the worst <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman">Wiki</a>]'>Catwoman</b> costume I've ever seen. And that includes <b title='Berry received $12.5 million for the title role in the film Catwoman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry">Wiki</a>]'>Halle Berry</b>'s.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's not Catwoman. She's just a generic cat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And that's the kind of <b title='careless, lazy'>sloppy</b> costuming which results from a lack of rules and competion.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What is your move?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back. She shrugs, I shrug. Subconsciously she's thinking, "We're in sync. We belong together."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where do you get this stuff?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, psychology journals, Internet research, and there's this great show on <b title='an American cable television network [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH-1">Wiki</a>]'>VH1</b> about how to <b title='successfully attract'>pick up</b> girls. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>If only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women, or around women...or at times even <b title='a man who is effeminate looks or behaves like a woman ↗feminine'>effeminate</b> men.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To a girl in a nurse costume) If that's a working <b title="a piece of equipment used by doctors for listening to someone's heart or breathing">stethoscope</b>, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat?<br>
<i>Girl</i>No, thanks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, seriously, you can. I have <b title='continuing only for a short time'>transient</b> <b title='having no known cause'>idiopathic</b> <b title='an irregularity in the force or rhythm of the heartbeat'>arrhythmia</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I want to <b title='gradually starts to know'>get to know</b> Penny's friends, I just don't know how to talk to these people.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I actually might be able to help.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall">Wiki</a>]'>Jane Goodall</b> observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured. But patterns emerge. They have their own language, if you will.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Go on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting, "How <b title='very drunk'>wasted</b> am I?" Which is met with an approving <b title='thing said or shouted by many people together '>chorus</b> of "Dude."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then what happens?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's as far as I've gotten.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This is ridiculous. I'm jumping in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good luck.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, you're coming with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I hardly think so.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>come on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes; but I need a <b title='also "wingman". a male who helps a person find a sexual partner for the night; a pilot whose plane is positioned behind and outside the leader in a formation of flying aircraft; partner in crime; sidekick'>wing man</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors, I'm much more suited to being the guy from the <b title='Federal Aviation Administration [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA">Wiki</a>]'>FAA</b> analyzing wreckage.<br>
(They approaches a girl)<br>
<i>Girl</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Girl</i>So what are you supposed to be?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Me? I'll give you a hint.<br>
<i>Girl</i>A <b title='locomotive train'>choo-choo train</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Excited) Close! (Does the sound again)<br>
<i>Girl</i>A brain damaged choo-choo train?<br>
(A girl drops down onto the couch and sits next to Raj)<br>
<i>Girl</i>How wasted am I?<br>
(Raj shrugs and smiles without saying anything. Sheldon and Leonard are talking to another girl. Sheldon does the sound again)<br>
<i>Girl</i>I still don't get it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm the Doppler effect.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Okay, if that's some sort of learning disability, I think it's very <b title='not realizing or caring how other people feel'>insensitive</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Frustrated) Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why don't you just tell people you're one of the <b title='Doc, Dopey, Bashful, Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy, and Happy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dwarfs">Wiki</a>] ↗Snow White'>seven dwarves</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because I'm Frodo.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. (He is big)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='a general exclamation'>snap</b>. So, I guess we'll be leaving now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why should we leave? For all we know he <b title='crash - arrive unexpectedly and uninvited'>crashed</b> the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.<br>
(Penny and her ex-boyfriend hug)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have a backup hypothesis?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe they just want to be friends. (He caresses her on the cheek)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then he and I are on equal ground.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is. (Leonard is shorter)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, if this was 1, 500 years ago, <b title='by means of, as a result of'>by virtue of</b> his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And male partners, animal partners, large <b title='used to describe things that belong to a very early time in the history of the world'>primordial</b> eggplants... <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> whatever tickled his fancy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, but our society has undergone a <b title='model'>paradigm</b> shift. In the Information Age, Sheldon, you and I are the <b title='the first letter of the Greek alphabet'>alpha</b> males. We shouldn't have to <b title='admit that you are wrong or that you have lost an argument'>back down</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. I'm going to assert my <b title='the fact of being more powerful, more important, or more noticeable than other people or things'>dominance</b> face-to-face.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Face-to-face? Are you gonna wait for him to sit down, or are you gonna stand on the coffee table?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys, are you having a good time?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a <b title='severe, harsh'>scathing</b> <b title='be an indictment of sth - be a very clear sign that a system, method etc is very bad or very wrong'>indictment</b> of the American education system.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>What, you're a zebra, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used for emphasis'>Yet</b> another child left behind.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>And what are you supposed to be, an <b title='a small magical being'>elf</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I'm a hobbit.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>What's the difference?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, a hobbit is a <b title='not able to live for ever'>mortal</b> <b title=' another name for J. R. R. Tolkien&#039;s Hobbit [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfling">Wiki</a>]'>halfling</b> inhabitant of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth">Wiki</a>]'>Middle-earth</b>, <b title='but in contrast'>whereas</b> an elf is an immortal, tall warrior.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because he's neither tall nor immortal and none of us could be The Flash.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Well, whatever. Why don't you go <b title='↗rabbit'>hop</b> off on a <b title='expedition'>quest</b>? I'm talking to Penny here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think we're all talking to Penny here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not. No offense.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Okay, maybe you didn't hear me. Go away.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, Kurt, be nice.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Oh, I am being nice. Right, little buddy? (Rubs Leonard's hair)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Kurt.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level so you're driven to <b title='resembling an animal or animals'>animalistic</b> <b title='exaggerated praise'>puffery</b>.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Call me a <b title='soft and full of air'>puffy</b> animal?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course not. No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I said "animalistic." I mean, of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If he understands that, you're in trouble.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>So, what, I'm unevolved?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're in trouble.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Kurt, please.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, it's okay. I can handle this. I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit. A hobbit. Are <b title='misfire - fail to achieve an anticipated result'>misfiring</b> <b title='neuron - nerve cell'>neurons</b> in your <b title='a major component of the brains of humans [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus">Wiki</a>]'>hippocampus</b> preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A <b title='an extinct species of humans considered to be an ancestor of modern humans [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis">Wiki</a>]'>homo habilis</b> discovering his <b title='The evolution of the fully opposable thumb is usually associated with Homo habilis, a forerunner of Homo sapiens. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb#Evolution">Wiki</a>]'>opposable thumbs</b> says what?<br>
<i>Kurt</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Chuckles) I think I've made my point.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Yeah? How about I make a point out of your <b title='having a point at one end'>pointy</b> little head?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical <b title='dispute, fight, or battle'>confrontation</b>, I will be less than useless.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's not going to be a confrontation. In fact, I doubt if he can even spell "confrontation."<br>
<i>Kurt</i>(Hold him around his waist and lifts him up) C- O-N... frontation!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Kurt, put him down <b title='now'>this instant</b>!<br>
<i>Kurt</i>He started it!<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't care. I'm finishing it. Put him down!<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Fine. You're one lucky little <b title='a type of fairy in Irish folklore [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun">Wiki</a>]'>leprechaun</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's a hobbit! (To Leonard) I <b title='get back - revenge'>got you back</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, are you okay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us. It's just getting a little late, so...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, okay. All right, well, thank you for coming.<br>
(Leonard motions for Sheldon to leave)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Penny) Happy Halloween. (Leaves) (To Leonard) If it's any consolation, I thought that homo habilis <b title='words'>line</b> really <b title='put sb in their place - show sb that they are not as clever or important as they think they are'>put him in his place</b>.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>What's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. (Leonard takes the tea) (Pats Leonard on the shoulder) <b title='used to comfort sb'>There, there</b>. You wanna talk about it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. "There, there" was really all I had.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good night, Leonard. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Knocks on the door and enters) Hey, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm fine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I am so sorry about what happened. (Goes over to the couch and sits down next to Leonard)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not your fault.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, it is. That's why I broke up with him. He always does stuff like that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So why was he at your party?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Sighs) Well, I ran into him last week and he was just all <b title='showing or saying that you are sorry ↗apology'>apologetic</b> about how he's changed. And he was just going on and on and... I believed him and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that. I can't go back to my party because he's there. And know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to... (Leans her head against his shoulder)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Pats her awkwardly) There, there.<br>
<i>Penny</i>God, what is wrong with me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nothing, you're perfect.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I'm not perfect.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, you are.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You really think so, don't you?<br>
(Kisses him on the lips)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How much have you had to drink tonight?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just... a lot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It might. Boy, you're really smart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I'm a <b title='fucking'>freaking</b> genius.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I should probably go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Probably.<br>
(Penny heads towoard the door; Leonard follows her)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you. (Leonard shrugs; she kisses him on the lip; Kurt appears)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we <b title='generally behave'>roll</b> in <b title='a region in the Middle-earth legendarium [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)">Wiki</a>]'>the Shire</b>. (Closes and bolts the door)
<s>The living room. Somone knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Coming. (Opens the door to reveal Howard)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's not here. Maybe the <b title='a team of superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)">Wiki</a>]'>Avengers</b> <b title='summon - order sb to come to a place'>summoned</b> him.<br>
