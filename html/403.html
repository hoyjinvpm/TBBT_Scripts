<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, I'm ready for my next question.<br>
<i>Amy</i>In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uganda.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='say or write sth in support of sb/sth'>Defend</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya <b title='wither - become less or weaker'>withers</b>, Uganda triumphs.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Correct. My turn.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does <b title='an African-American composer and pianist. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin">Wiki</a>]'>Scott Joplin</b> play The Maple Leaf <b title='a piece of ragtime music [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime">Wiki</a>]'>Rag</b>?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Tuned <b title='bayonet - a long, sharp knife that is fastened onto the end of a rifle and used as a weapon in battle'>bayonets</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Defend.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Isn't it obvious?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're right. My apologies.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell are you guys playing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a game we invented. It's called <b title='factual - based on or containing facts. counter- - against/opposite ↗counterstrike'>Counterfactuals</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>We <b title='suggest or accept that sth is true so that it can be used as the basis for a theory etc'>postulate</b> an <b title='alternative (different from what is usual, expected, or traditional)'>alternate</b> world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then <b title='ask a question, esp one that needs serious thought'>pose</b> questions to each other.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right. I like a good brainteaser. <b title='try sth as an experiment'>Give it a whirl</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, a <b title='A BLT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato) is a type of bacon sandwich'>BLT</b> where the B stands for beaver? I don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, be serious. We're playing a game here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can figure this out, let's see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I'll say cinnamon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese <b title='Danish pastry - a small fairly flat sweet cake, often with fruit inside'>Danish</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Amy</i>In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. <b title='feeling extremely shocked and sad'>Devastated</b>, the <b title='Dane - native of Denmark'>Danes</b> never invent their <b title='sb/sth with the same name as sb/sth else'>namesake</b> pastry. How does one miss that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This is ridiculous. You're just making stuff up.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Is he always like this when he loses?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes. You should've been here for the great <b title='a game of physical and mental skill. During the game, players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of 54 blocks. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Wiki</a>]'>Jenga</b> <b title='a sudden short period when sb, esp a child, behaves very angrily and unreasonably'>tantrum</b> of 2008.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You bumped the table and you know it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm going to my room.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Very good, Leonard. But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding.
<s>The Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersolid">Wiki</a>]'>supersolids</b>? It's pretty interesting. This guy's working from a hypothesis where-<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='a comment which discloses plot details of a book, play, video game, or film'>Spoiler</b> alert! Spoiler alert.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the <b title='a container used by very young children as a toilet'>potty</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>On the potty? What are you, five?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's a potty. What do you call it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Toilet.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's a little <b title='rude, offensive'>vulgar</b> for the dinner table, don't you think?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, and potty is okay?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you do in the potty, <b title='pee, urinate'>wee-wee</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>If I don't have to <b title='↗defecation, number two'>boom</b>-boom.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. Hi.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nice to see you.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry we're late.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ah, ah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe she's experiencing her <b title='monthly flow of blood, menstruation, period'>menses</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Actually, I'm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah, ah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. Toilet's sounding pretty good now, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, look, it's Shamy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Shamy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A <b title='childish'>juvenile</b> <b title='merge'>amalgamation</b> of our names. Sheldon and Amy, Shamy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh. I don't like that. Don't do that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All righty. What's new?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don't like that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Like everybody else's. Subject to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>entropy</b>, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. (To Sheldon) Why is she not taking our order?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I should've warned you, one has to navigate a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth">Wiki</a>] ↗maze'>labyrinth</b> of social nonsense before one can be fed here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Really? I assumed an <b title='an organization or institution, especially a business, shop etc'>establishment</b> called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called <b title='a form of fraud used in retail sales but also employed in other contexts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch">Wiki</a>]'>bait and switch</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't wanna be here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, this is nice. First time we've all gotten together to eat.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You're right, he's a festival of <b title='tedious'>humdrum</b> <b title='friendly conversation about things that are not very important, casual conversation, small talk'>chitchat</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, that's all I got. Howard, you're up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Um, tell us about your work, Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I doubt you'd understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Raj, do you have any questions for Amy? (Raj slowly shakes his head)<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They can't function without me. I'm the social glue that holds this little group together. (To the group) You're welcome.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl and she's my friend, but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry">Wiki</a>]'>raspberry</b> jelly from the corner of my mouth. It's an action we both regret to this day.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit for our little, how should we call it, <b title='an interstellar faction of the fictional universe of Star Wars [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Alliance">Wiki</a>]'>rebel alliance</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I've always been more of an empire man.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, not my point.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know what your point is. You're intimidated by Amy's intellect. To that I say, <b title='become happier'>buck up</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, <b title='showing that one feels morally better than other people'>sanctimonious</b> and frankly, just <b title='very offensive, unpleasant, or rude'>obnoxious</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So we already have you for all that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-<b title='a scale of musical notes that starts on one specific note'>key</b> country music <b title='caterwaul - make the loud unpleasant noise that is typical of a cat ↗wail, sex noise'>caterwauling</b>, the unappetizing <b title='a very impressive show or scene'>spectacle</b> of her grinding a <b title='very light grey rock from a volcano that is crushed to a powder and used for cleaning [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumice">Wiki</a>]'>pumice stone</b> against her <b title='rough and covered in calluses. callus - area of thick hardened skin'>calloused</b> feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the <b title='an American reality television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Jersey Shore</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Suffered in silence?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. And I'd thank you to do the same.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Silence?
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear <b title='a major mountain range in western North America [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains">Wiki</a>]'>Rocky Mountain</b> spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='Located in the Northeastern United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia">Wiki</a>]'>Philadelphia</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? I thought they were out west someplace.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Think about it, Raj. Where did <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky">Wiki</a>]'>the movie Rocky</b> take place?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, this is the plan? <b title='from this moment and always in the future'>From now on</b>, we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another <b title='the ultimate fix for a problem [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet#Idiomatic_usage">Wiki</a>]'>silver bullet</b> my way?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get one yourself.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.<br>
<i>Penny</i>God, he's an <b title='stupid person'>ass</b> when he drinks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't. You just don't hear it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think we need to start <b title='entertain an idea/hope/thought etc - consider ~'>entertaining</b> the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I thought you were gonna talk to Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I did.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what'd he say?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to <b title='accept sb/sth that is annoying, unpleasant etc without complaining'>put up with</b> you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Kinda, sorta had to?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't agree with him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you defended me, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I tried, but (Penny starts rubbing her foot with a pumice stone) he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're not doing that right.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='give me'>Gimme</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Trust me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the <b title='pattern made by the lines of fibres in wood, or of layers in rock, coal etc'>grain</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, that is better.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And someday, when you have <b title='veins that have become enlarged and tortuous (twisted) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins">Wiki</a>]'>varicose veins</b>, I'll show you how to massage them.
<s>The University Cafeteria.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, God, never again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of <b title='40 ounce beer (1.2 L)'>40s</b>, a box of <b title='a brand of jerky snacks or dried sausage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Jim_%28snack_food%29">Wiki</a>]'>Slim Jims</b> and the latest issue of Bombay <b title='buttocks'>Badonkadonks</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I was homesick.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood">Wiki</a>]'>Bollywood</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-boying">Wiki</a>]'>breakdancing</b> skills. (Does a stereotyped <b title='↗ape, copy, imitate, impersonate, mock, simulate'>impersonation</b> of Bollywood dancing.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's very offensive.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, we all thought so.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='Lennon and Yoko Ono [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon#Yoko_Ono">Wiki</a>]'>John and Yoko</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>More like Yoko and Yoko.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Greetings.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing.<br>
<i>Amy</i>It's very impressive, for theoretical work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do I detect a hint of <b title='condescend - treat sb as if you are better or more important than them'>condescension</b>?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what's the word I'm looking for? Hmm, cute.<br>
<i>Leonard & Howard</i>Oooh!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm stating it <b title='openly and honestly'>outright</b>. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You take that back.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological <b title='substrate - a molecule that is acted upon by an enzyme [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)">Wiki</a>]'>substrates</b> that <b title='be useful to'>subserve</b> global information processing, which is required for all <b title='connected with mental processes of understanding'>cognitive</b> reasoning, including <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_scientific_inquiry">Wiki</a>]'>scientific inquiry</b>, making my research <b title='by the fact itself'>ipso facto</b> prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it's better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, but a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">Wiki</a>]'>grand unified theory</b>, <b title='used to introduce a statement which explains and adds to sth you have just said'>insofar</b> as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes, but if I'm successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in <b title='derive - obtain ↗deprive'>deriving</b> a grand unified theory, and therefore, <b title='include sb/sth as a member of a group or type'>subsume</b> your conclusions under my <b title='model'>paradigm</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's the <b title='rank - offensive'>rankest</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologism">Wiki</a>]'>psychologism</b>, and was <b title='conclusive - showing that sth is definitely true'>conclusively</b> revealed as <b title='nonsense'>hogwash</b> by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!<br>
<i>Amy</i>We appear to have reached an <b title='deadlock'>impasse</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I agree. I <b title='propose sth formally for discussion and decision at a meeting ↗motion'>move</b> our relationship terminate immediately.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='second - formally support a motion etc'>Seconded</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There being no objections?<br>
<i>All</i>No, uh-uh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The motion <b title='carry - approve sth by a majority of votes'>carries</b>. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Good day, Sheldon Cooper. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Women, huh? Can't live with them, can't successfully <b title='deny / rebut (say or prove that a statement or criticism is false)'>refute</b> their hypotheses.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='I certainly agree with that'>Amen to that</b>.
<s>The laundry room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I hear you broke up with Amy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow. That's like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Regarding what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Amy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't follow.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, I assure you, I'm fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the <b title='sever - divide or break or separate sth by cutting'>severing</b> of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply <b title='outlive its/your usefulness - become no longer useful'>outlived its utility</b>, and I'm continuing on with my life as before.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a <b title='a cat - used especially by or to children'>pussycat</b>.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I gotta tell you guys, I'm a little worried about Sheldon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're all a little worried about Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I mean since the Shamy hit a <b title='a line of sharp rocks ↗coral'>reef</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I'm worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jell-o">Wiki</a>]'>Jell-O</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What does hit a reef mean?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, went <b title='into a state of separation or breakup. -ville - having a quality (humorously)'>splitsville</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Pardon?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Turned to <b title='poo-poo'>boom-boom</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think Sheldon really misses Amy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He got a cat to keep him company.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He takes the kitty to the potty?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I thought we discussed the P-word.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't try to change me, dude. I am what I am.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Carrying the cat) Oh, gentlemen.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us to your little friend?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My apologies. Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer">Wiki</a>]'>Robert Oppenheimer</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, if you'll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<s>The apartment. Leonard arrives.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey. (Turns to see Sheldon now has five cats) Oh, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So you decided to get the whole <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Wiki</a>]'>Manhattan Project</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Zazzles?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he's so <b title='very very great'>zazzy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, we need to talk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>About what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Cats, Sheldon. You're clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Clowder.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, yeah, fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's the kind of thing you ought to know, now that we have one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It wasn't a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I got it, I got it, she's not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my <b title='a musical instrument like a large violin'>cello</b>, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You didn't break up, she dumped you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She didn't dump me. It was mutual!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was there. She dumped you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of <b title='them'>'em</b>. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't have to <b title='make sb want sth'>sell</b> me on cats, Leonard. I'm already a fan. All right, fellas, who's in the mood for <b title='a brand of gourmet cat food [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Feast">Wiki</a>]'>Fancy Feast</b>? Well, that's not fancy at all.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Where is he?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's in his bedroom.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids <b title='whip up - quickly make sth'>whipped up</b> in a lab?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, she's real.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Did they <b title='do sth that is against religious rules'>sin</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, it's not like that. It's, uh, I don't know what it's like. But there is something I should prepare you for.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I've seen him at his best, I've seen him at his worst. There's nothing he can do that'll surprise me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on to that thought. (Knocks on Sheldon's bedroom door)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Come in. (They enter. The room is full of cats.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Surprise.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>My</b>, my, that's a powerful smell.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf-<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Leonard called, and he said that you were <b title='if you pine for sb, you feel very unhappy because they are not with you'>pining for</b> a young lady.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that's <b title='absurd'>preposterous</b>. I'm not pining over anyone.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Oh, <b title='a sock puppet sheep [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_Chop_%28puppet%29">Wiki</a>]'>Lamb Chop</b>, we can <b title='argue about small unimportant details'>quibble</b> what to call it, but I think we can both agree it's creepy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don't argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>(To Leonard) You should've called sooner.
<s>The kitchen.</s>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Shelly! Dinner's ready!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Coming!<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>No cats!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Aw.(Enters to find Amy) What is she doing here?<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>I called her.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, <b title='used for emphasis'>rest assured</b>, I am in full possession of my <b title='faculty - any of the powers of the body or mind'>faculties</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Pretending to sneeze) 25 cats!<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, but you're not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Then stop talking.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, ma'am.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I've ever met.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can't see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they're there.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Excellent point.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A physics point.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='used for admitting that sb has said sth better, funnier, or cleverer in answer to what you or sb else has just said'>Touché</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it's a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn't have to end it for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted <b title='too quickly'>rashly</b>. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'll agree to that only if you'll <b title='state clearly and firmly'>stipulate</b> that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll go as high as 40.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sixty-five.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly <b title='titillate - make sb sexually interested ↗arouse, turn on'>titillating</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you like to see my cats?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I would. I love cats. They're <b title='the best possible example of sth ↗classic'>the epitome of</b> <b title='lack of interest or sympathy'>indifference</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little <b title='a cloying attitude or quality annoys you because it is too sweet or nice'>cloying</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I saw what you did there.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>He thinks he's such a <b title='sb who wants to appear to be clever'>smarty-pants</b>. He's no different from any man. You tell 'em not to do something, that's all they wanna do. If I hadn't told my brother <b title='short and thick'>Stumpy</b> not to clear out the <b title='a machine used for reducing wood (generally tree limbs or trunks) into smaller woodchips [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodchipper">Wiki</a>]'>wood chipper</b> by hand, we'd still be calling him Edward. Now, don't you move. I'll bring over all the food.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, no, I can do it.<br>
<i>Mrs. Cooper</i>Well, isn't that <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>?
<s>Outside. Sheldon is sitting at a table with a sign reading "Cats $20"</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you, Amy. Here's your cat. And here's your $20.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Next!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you, Amy. Here's your cat. And here's your $20.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Next!
