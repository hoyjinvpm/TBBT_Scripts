<i>Sheldon</i>我的<b title='Actuall, his Xing is Cooper'>zing</b>是Sheldon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. It's 我的名字是Sheldon. (He's right)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>我的名字是Sheldon. (Makes a walk-down-stairs gesture [<a target=_blank href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29#Tones%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29#Tones">Tones</a>])<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Mocks him) What's this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's what you did.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I assumed, as a number of languages the gesture was part of the phrase.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, it's not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal <b title='idiosyncrasy - unusual habit'>idiosyncrasies</b> from the subject matter.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Once you're fluent you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Leonard) Mei Du Lu Yi Zi. (Waves his hand and smirks)<br>
<i>Howard</i>You just called Leonard a <b title='syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis">Wiki</a>]'>syphylitic</b> donkey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My apologies, Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why are you learning Chinese?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe the Szechuan restaurant has been passing the orange chicken off as <b title='an orange-colored citrus fruit [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine">Wiki</a>]'>tangerine</b> chicken and I intend to confront them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If I were you, I'd be more concerned with what they're passing off as chicken.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) I need to use your window.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh hey yeah no sure, go ahead.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Yells at someone) Hey <b title='jerk (mean person)'>jerk-face</b>, you forgot your iPod. (Throws it out of the window and slam the window shut)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I'll tell you what's going on. That stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. (Goes back to the window) <b title='general insult ↗仆街'>Drop dead</b>, you stupid self-centred bastard! (To the guys) Thank you. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, where were we?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not now, I have a blog to find. (Goes use Leonard's laptop)
<s>The hallway. Leonard knocks at Penny's door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, are you okay?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful-<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Yells) Go away!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, feel better, bye. (Goes back into the living room) She doesn't wanna talk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not surprising. Penny's emotional responses originate in the primitive portion of the brain, known as the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">Wiki</a>]'>amygdala</b>, while speech is centred in the much more <b title='not long ago'>recently</b> developed <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-cortex">Wiki</a>]'>neocortex</b>, the former can easily overpower the latter <b title='If you give credence to a theory or story, you believe it.'>giving scientific credence</b> to the notion of being <b title='render - cause sb/sth to be in a particular condition'>rendered</b> speechless. (Leonard is rendered speechless) Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Enters) Hey, look, I found an iPod.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What else, sell it on eBay as slightly used.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's Penny's boy friend's, they broke up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her and if the moment feels right, see if you can <b title='touch sb in a sexual way without their permission'>cop a feel</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not going to do that, Howard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not aware of any social conventions that requires you to intervene at all.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about <b title='a young woman who needs help or protection - used humorously'>damsel in distress</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>12th century <b title='a set of rules, laws, or principles that tell people how to behave'>code</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry">Wiki</a>]'>chivalry</b>? Not exactly <b title='generally accepted'>current</b>. You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't care. She's upset, I'm going over there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm her friend, I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, you're saying, if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her <b title='exactly'>right</b> there, right now, you'll just walk away?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.
<s>Penny's apartment. She's eating a tub of ice-cream when Leonard knocks at the door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey, listen, I know you said you didn't wanna talk-<br>
<i>Penny</i>(With voice baffled by a mouthful of ice-cream) I don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Comes back again) Did you say wait?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. So I pick good guys but turn them into losers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course not.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, it's gotta be one or the other. Which is it? (Stares at him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, what were the choices again?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal nonfreaky smart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, no, sure.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, and then he just <b title='go and do sth - used esp to express anger that sb has done sth foolish'>goes and has</b> to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I tell you, it's not all that easy to find.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, really? My friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my e-mail a number of prisoners at the Michigan state <b title='prison'>penitentiary</b> found it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ok. What exactly did this guy write? <b title='used to say you are not suggesting sth'>Not that</b> I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought- never mind.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you know what? You <b title='used for saying that it would not make any difference'>might as well</b> read it, everybody else has. Go ahead. (Points at her laptop. Lenord goes to read it) Oh god, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. Just wanna crawl into a hole and die. (Sprays some cheese into her mouth. [<a target=_blank href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Cheese  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Cheese%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Cheese">Easy Cheese</a>])<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Well, you know, this isn't that bad. It-it just paints the picture of a very <b title='showing in a gentle way that you love sb and care about them'>affectionate</b> woman who is open to expressing her affection in nontraditional <b title='places'>locales</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, god.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Elevators, parks, movie theaters, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_%28restaurant%29">Wiki</a>]'>Subway</b> the sandwich shop?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sandwich shop.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Doesn't that violate the health <b title='a set of rules, laws, or principles that tell people how to behave'>code</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, at the subshop we were only <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, okay. But my-my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Do you think I overreacted?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe a little.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I do that. I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No, no, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied <b title='a situation in which information must be kept secret'>confidentiality</b> of the bedroom and in your case the elevator, parks and fast-food franchise.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're right. I should just say I'm done with him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, you should. Go ahead, say it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>But I never gave the man a chance to explain.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is there to explain? It's all right here, betrayal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you were right the first time. This is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way was trying to show people how he feels.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm pretty sure I never said that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. (Hugs him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah... <b title='used to show approval'>Good for me</b>. (Penny runs toward the door) Where are you going?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm going over to Mike's. Leonard, thank you so much. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, sure. Oh, maybe I am her gay friend. (Leaves too)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn't make my point with those people.<br>
<i>Howard</i>For God's shake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I like tangerine chicken I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can we please change the subject?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure. Tell us again how you <b title='do sth badly'>screwed up</b> and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just roll the dice.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Enslaved by <b title='warlock - sorcerer, wizard'>warlocks</b>, stay here until you roll 2, 4 or 6.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She was mad at him! She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually I thought the first two <b title='a particular way of performing sth ↗render'>renditions</b> were far more <b title='interesting or exciting enough to keep your attention completely'>compelling</b>. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character. Now I just find him to be whiney and annoying.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Eat your tangerine chicken.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Storms into the room) Thank you so much for your stupid advice. (Slams the door and leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Incredible. You <b title='succeed in doing sth'>managed to</b> screw up the screwup.
<s>Penny's living room. She's sitting on the couch while crying.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Knocks and enters) I'm back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I went over to Mike's to <b title='settle an argument; become friends again'>make up with</b> him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. No, I know that part.<br>
<i>Penny</i>But he had already <b title='develop in your life, and change your relationships, interests, activities etc'>moved on</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Already? That was quick.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's what I said to the woman who <b title='↗blowjob, oral sex'>had her legs wrapped around his neck</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How could he do that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, you did throw an <b title='iPod Classic 5th/6th 80 GB US$249 [<a href="http://ipod.about.com/od/understandingipodmodels/g/ipod_classic_de.htm">about</a>]'>80 giga iPod</b> (Penny looks at him) Yeah no, how can he do that? (Slaps against the coffee table)<br>
<i>Penny</i>I swear to God I'm done with guys like that. You know <b title='behaving in a way traditionally considered typical of a man'>macho</b> with the perfect body and the hair and the money.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, that must get old quick.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, just once I would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Sobbing) What about you what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about if you went out with me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you asking me out?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, yes, I am... asking you out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was just <b title='go - say'>going</b> <b title='from, out of'>off</b> your comment about the nice guy-<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I know. I got that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, and honest.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, totally.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, but, it's no big deal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, I will go out with you. (The audience applaud)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Why not? I mean, what do I have to lose?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. That's the spirit.
<s>Staircase and first floor of the building. Sheldon is wearing earphones and practicing Mandarin.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Checking mail) Show me your citrus peels. 给我看你有的陈皮。Show me your citrus peels. 给我看你有的陈皮。<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters, taps him on the shoulder and startles him) Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>哎呀，吓死我了！<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry. Look, do you have a second?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A second what? Pair of underwear?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I was just wondering if I could talk to you. It's about Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz. (Goes over to the staircase with Penny in tow)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, I suppose he is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All I'm saying is you know Leonard the best.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not necessarily. I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered he not only has a <b title='a rough bath sponge, made from the dried inner part of a tropical fruit'>loofah</b>, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_cell">Wiki</a>]'>epithelial cell</b> <b title='let skin fall'>slough</b> off naturally, but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process... and until recently I had no idea that despite his <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance">Wiki</a>]'>lactose intolerance</b> he can tolerate small amounts of low-fat ice cream without producing a <b title='harmful, poisonous'>noxious</b> gas that I maintain, in the right concentration, could be weaponized.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard might come home, could we talk in my apartment?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We're not done?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>哎呀，why not. We're already <b title='Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a novel by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), the sequel to Alice&#039;s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_looking_glass">Wiki</a>]'>through the looking glass</b> anyway.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Uh. Okay. So, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, he didn't actually say anything. But when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia#Film">Wiki</a>]'>Fantasia</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's nice. (Goes over to the couch and sits down) <b title='anyway'>Anyhow</b>, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is: you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just... You wanna sit down?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I wish it were that simple. I don't spend much time here and so I've never really chosen a place to sit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, choose.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There are a number of options and- I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and <b title='spreading of things'>dispersion</b> of sunlight to make an <b title='a choice that is based on knowledge of a subject or situation'>informed choice</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Alright, why don't you just pick one at random and then if you don't like it, you can sit somewhere else next time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, that's crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Um, here's the thing. So I've known for a while <b title='because of sth, as a result of sth'>now that</b> Leonard has had a little <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on me-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A little crush? Well, I suppose so, in the same way <b title='a king of Mycenaean (pre-Dorian) Sparta, the husband of Helen of Troy, and a central figure in the Trojan War.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus">Wiki</a>]'>Menelaus</b> had a little crush on <b title='also known as Helen of Sparta [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy">Wiki</a>]'>Helen of Troy</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Alright. Yeah, I don't really know who they are-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, Menelaus was the brother of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon">Wiki</a>]'>Agamemnon</b>-<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't care. I don't care. Listen, the point is: Leonard isn't the <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> guy I usually go out with.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. (Sits down on the couch) Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your last one worked out well for Koothrappali, he got a free iPod. (Sits down in a chair by the window) Oh, glare. (Shades his face and goes away)<br>
<i>Penny</i>But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard I risk losing a really good friend. You know, guessing he's not looking for a <b title='a short and not very serious sexual relationship'>fling</b>. He's the kinda guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, would you say light years.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Pulls out a chair and sits in it) I would not say that. No one would say that. A light year is a unit of distance, not time.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you for the clarification.<br>
[Sheldon squirms in the chair]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Draft. (Gets up) You see, people hear the word "year" and they think duration. And <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-pound">Wiki</a>]'>foot-pound</b> has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right, thanks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Sits down in a green chair) Hmm, it's common mistake.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not the first one I've made today.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. I think this will be my seat.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with you know, what I'm talking about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, let's see. We might consider <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrodinger%27s_cat">Wiki</a>]'>Shrodinger's cat</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Shrodinger. Is that the woman in 2A?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, that's Mrs. Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a <b title='a dog [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_hairless">Wiki</a>]'>Mexican hairless</b>. Annoying little animla. <b title='If a dog or other animal yips, it gives a sudden short cry'>Yip</b> yip yip.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry, you <b title="divert - take sb's attention">diverted</b> me. Anyway, In 1935, Erwin Shrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhgen interpretation of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics">Wiki</a>]'>quantum physics</b>, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed <b title='a very small bottle'>vial</b> of poison that will break open at random time. Now, since no one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Stunned for a while) I'm sorry, I don't get the point.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You have to be <b title='having the ability to know what other people are thinking or what will happen in the future'>psychic</b> to get it and there's no such thing as psychic.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, what's the point?!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just like Shrodinger's cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. So you're saying I should go out with Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No no no no no no. Let me start again. In 1935... (Penny covers her face with her hands)
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Two seats right there. (Two Asians, a boy and a girl are sitting at the table)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To the boy) 长寿石灰？(They are bemused) 谢谢。(Cast an exultant glance at Leonard. They sit down)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can see that. Unless you're planning on running a Marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's about Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A mistake involving Penny. Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't think I can go out with her tonight.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Other people would say "why not?"<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Other people might be interested.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm gonna talk anyway.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I assumed you would.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm <b title='↗vomit, throw up, sick'>nauseous</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent <b title='the act of forcing sth out of sth else'>expulsion</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You also made a common grammartical mistake. You said nauseous when you meant <b title='nauseate - make sb feel that they are going to vomit'>nauseated</b>. But go on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny. What happens if I <b title='↗ruin, spoil, screw'>blow</b> it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, if we accept your premise and also accept the highly <b title='unlikely'>improbable</b> assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no <b title='↗offspring, issue'>progeny</b>, an image of any number of evil light housekeepers from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-doo">Wiki</a>]'>Scooby-Doo</b> cartoons comes to mind.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're not helping.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alright. What response on my part would bring this conversation to a <b title='quick'>speedy</b> conclusion?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Tell me whether or not to <b title='do sth you have planned or agreed to do, esp after not being sure you want to do'>go through with</b> this date.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Shrodinger's cat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow. That's brilliant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You sound surprised. (Eats a forkful of his food) Hmm. (To the boy) 猴子睡在里头 (Rubs his tummy)

<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on in.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. You look very nice.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you. So do you.<br>
[Awkward silence]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I made an 8 o'clock reservation.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Yeah. Great. Listen, um, maybe we should talk first.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Shrodinger's cat?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Actually, I've heard far too much about that cat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good. (They kiss passionately)<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. The cat's alive. Let's go to dinner.
