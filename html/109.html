<i>Howard</i>Are we ready on the stereo?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Go for stereo.<br>

<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hey guys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's a little loud.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No problem... Turning it down. San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax... (The music fades out) And <b title='French "see there" [<a href="http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/voila. htm">link</a>]'>voilà</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>OK, thanks. (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on, hang on. Do you not realise what we just did?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we turned our stereo down, by sending a signal around the world via the Internet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. You know you can get one of those universal remotes at <b title='an American franchise of electronics retail stores [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack">Wiki</a>]'>RadioShack</b>? They're really cheap.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No no no, you don't get it. Um, uh, Howard, enable public access.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Public access enabled.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Not impressed) <b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, that's terrific. I'll see ya.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No hang on, hang on...<br>
(The lights go off and on)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Someone in Sichuan province, China, is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's handy. Um, here's a question... Why?<br>
<i>Boys</i>Because we can.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! They found our remote control cars!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, what's on top of that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wireless webcams, wave hello!<br>
<i>Howard</i>The <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_truck">Wiki</a>]'>monster truck</b> is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv">Wiki</a>]'>Tel Aviv</b>.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>You may wanna put on <b title='(casual) pants'>slacks</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? Ew, stop it! No! Leave me alone! (Runs off, with the cars in tow)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who's running the red <b title='a sports car by the Chevrolet division of General Motors (GM) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette">Wiki</a>]'>Corvette</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That would be me.
<s>The living room, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know in the future, when we're <b title='separated from the body'>disembodied</b> brains in jars, we're going to look at this as eight hours well wasted.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't wanna be in a jar. I want my brain in an <b title='a robot that looks completely human'>android</b> body. Eight feet tall and ribbed.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm <b title='agreeing with/supporting'>with</b> you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. (Everyone looks at him) I promised my mother.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I suppose you could have your android penis <b title='cut off the skin at the end of the penis'>circumcised</b>. But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not to mention you'd have to <b title='Shabbat is the Jewish day of rest... observed from a few minutes before sunset on Friday evening until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat">Wiki</a>]'>power down on Saturdays</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but <b title='among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. The razor states that one should proceed to simpler theories until simplicity can be traded for greater explanatory power. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_Rasor">Wiki</a>]'>Occam's razor</b> would suggest that someone threw it out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's from the Institute of Experimental Physics, they want us to present our paper on the properties of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersolid">Wiki</a>]'>supersolids</b> at the topical conference of <b title='a state of matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose-Einstein_condensates">Wiki</a>]'>Bose-Einstein condensates</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. I read it before I threw it out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ok, if I may drill down to the <b title='basis/foundation'>bedrock</b> of my question: why did you throw it out?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose room of the <b title='a city in Los Angeles County, California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena, _California">Wiki</a>]'>Pasadena</b> <b title='an international hotel company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriot">Wiki</a>]'>Marriot</b>, in front of a group of judgmental strangers who wouldn't recognize true genius if it was standing in front of them giving a speech. Which if I were there, it would be.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know, Sheldon. Those topical conferences on Bose-Einstein condensates' parties are legendary.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Forget the parties!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Forget the parties? What a nerd.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are there any other honours I've got that I don't know about? Did <b title='United Parcel Service is international shipping company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service">Wiki</a>]'>UPS</b> dropped off a Nobel prize with my name on it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel prize, is the day I begin my research on the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient">Wiki</a>]'>drag coefficient</b> of <b title='tassel - a large number of threads tied together at one end and hung as a decoration on clothes, curtains etc'>tassels</b> on flying carpets.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Laughs) The only thing missing from that insult was: "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_mama">Wiki</a>]'>your mama</b>".<br>
<i>Howard</i>I got one... Hey Leonard, Your mama's research methodology is so flawed...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we don't. We have to take a nourishment, to expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying. Everything else is optional.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ok, let me put it this way: I'm doing it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't. I'm the lead author.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='exclamation of disbelief, displeasure or exasperation'>Come on</b>, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically. I let you think we went alphabetically to <b title='show mercy to'>spare</b> you the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Now to put too fine a point to it, but I was <b title='give sb a small reward or compliment'>throwing you a bone</b>. You're welcome.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It doesn't need proving.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wh- So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They<b title='be supposed to - have a duty or a responsibility to'>'re not supposed to</b>, but they should.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Alright, I don't care what you say. I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I forbid it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You forbid it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, you admit that it's our work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. Once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh no, he didn't. (Snaps his fingers)
<s>Leonard's bedroom. Penny is helping him figure out what he could wear to the talk.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So, how's it going with Sheldon? Are you guys still not talking to each other?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic <b title='science fiction'>sci-fi</b> movie <b title='a 1981 Canadian science-fiction action horror film. In the film, "scanners" are people with unusual telepathic and telekinetic powers. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanners">Wiki</a>]'>Scanners</b>? Like.... bzzz. Never mind. How about this one? It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I didn't know they still made <b title='a textile composed of twisted fibers [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corduroy">Wiki</a>]'>corduroy</b> suits.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They don't, that's why I saved this one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok, well, let's just see what else you have. Ok, here. Take this. And this, and this, and this, and these...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is this all stuff you want me to try on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's the bottled city of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandor">Wiki</a>]'>Kandor</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton. It was miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, nice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here, why don't you put these while I find a shirt and a <b title="a man's jacket for informal occasions">sport coat</b> to match.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great, be right back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Where are you going? Just put them on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Here?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, are you shy?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I'm not shy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Don't worry I won't look.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know you won't look. Why would you look? There's nothing to see... Well, not 'nothing'...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sweetie, put the pants on. So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to <b title='combine'>synthesize</b> facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is <b title='the craziest of crazy people are batshit crazy [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091022081707AA4be4j">link</a>]'>bat-crap crazy</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, careful. That's my original series <b title='an American science fiction franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica">Wiki</a>]'>Battlestar Galactica</b> fun suit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok, alright, moving on. Oh, wow. A <b title='a pattern consisting of curved shapes'>paisley</b> shirt.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It goes with my corduroy suit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>If you mean it should end up in the same place, then I agree. Is this your only tie?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh. Technically, yes. But, if you'll notice... reversible! So it works as two.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sweetie, I don't even think it works as one. Is this all your clothes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The-the eighth grade?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My last <b title='when you reach a certain age, you grow taller by more than usual.'>growth sprout</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. (Leonard grabs a shirt) I said no. Put it down.
<s>The staircase and hallway. Sheldon is checking mail.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get anything good?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't. (Sheldon looks at her thoughtfully) It was a joke. (Sheldon "laughs") Yep. Tip you waitresses. I'm here all week.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness, know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.<br>
(They start to climb the stairs)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah ok, me too. Zip it, lock it. (Mimes zipping her mouth) Put it in your pocket. So, you and Leonard...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh dear God...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Little misunderstanding, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A little misunderstanding...? <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo">Wiki</a>]'>Galileo</b> and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How do you feel?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't understand the question.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I haven't thought about it like that. I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological <b title='very clear sign'>manifestations</b> of some sort of unconscious emotional <b title='a state of confusion, disorder, uncertainty, or great anxiety'>turmoil</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I couldn't poop this morning. (His bowel movements is supposed to run like a German train schedule)<br>
<i>Penny</i>You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can <b title='work out - solve a problem'>work this out</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Certainly preferable to my plan.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Which was?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A powerful <b title='↗constipation, diarrhoea'>laxative</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok. So you absolutely should talk to him. Look, I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself without your little idea there's no way he could come up with this whole experiment thing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Slowly turns around) Excuse me. "Little idea"?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course you didn't. He said "Little idea"?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, well, no... not... not in those words.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In what words then, exactly?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you know... Gee. The exact words are... it's more the spirit in which he said...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What did he say?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You had a lucky <b title='a feeling that sth is true or will happen, although you do not know any definite facts about it'>hunch</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Comes out of the apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't you ever speak to me again. (Storms into the apartment and slams the door)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What...?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw. He... (Mimes that Sheldon is crazy and then go into her apartment)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Dressed up) Ok, I'm leaving for the conference.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch." (<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quote">Wiki</a>]'>Air quotes</b>)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then why did you say it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know, I wasn't...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Were you trying to impress Penny?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, not at all. A little bit.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How'd that work out for you?<br>

<i>Leonard</i>(To Penny) Let's go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bye Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Goodbye Penny. (Stares at Leonard and tries to get his brain to explode) Bshh! One of these days... (Mimes the explosion of Leonard's brain)

<i>Penny</i><b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb'>There you go</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right, this side does look better.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, I didn't say better, I said "less stained".<br>
<i>Howard</i>I just checked the house. There's probably 20-25 people in there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is that all?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>"All?" In particle physics 25 is <b title='The Woodstock Music & Art Fair [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock">Wiki</a>]'>Woodstock</b>!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Well, then good!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm all nervous.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's ok, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, joke... Ok. How about this? Um, ok... uh, there's this farmer, and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so... he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says: "Um, I have a solution, but, um, it-it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum". (Howard, Raj and Leonard laugh; Penny is not amused at all) Right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sorry, I just had heard it before.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title="Let's go">Let's roll</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, nice suit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's a classic, right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I really should have brought my own car.
<s>The Rose Room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia">Wiki</a>]'>inertia</b> changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (Gets a round of applause) Thank you! (Penny is sleeping, leaning her head on Howard's shoulder) Are there any questions?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. What the hell was that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Any other questions?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper. (Pauses) Thank you. (Goes over the front of the room) And you sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park and I saw these children on a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry-go-round">Wiki</a>]'>merry-go-round</b> which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't skip it. It's just an <b title='a short, amusing story'>anecdote</b>, it's not science.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Oh, I see. It was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are not Isaac Newton.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, that's true. Gravity would've been apparent to me without the apple.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You cannot possibly be that arrogant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You continue to underestimate me, <b title='used to address a male friend'>my good man</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need <b title='validate - make sb feel that their ideas and feelings are respected and considered seriously'>validation</b> from <b title='↗great minds think alike'>lesser minds</b>. (To the audience) No offense.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really, so why did you come?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because I knew you'd screw this up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't screw it up!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>. I admit that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But it was straight downhill from there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, I've had enough of your <b title='condescent - behave as if you think you are better, more intelligent, or more important than other people ↗contempt, patronize'>condescendship</b>. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you. Maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room! (To the audience) No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is <b title='torment - make sb suffer a lot, esp mentally'>tormented</b> by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So you admit you're an <b title='sb who thinks they are more important than other people and need not care about them'>egotist</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes! (To the audience) My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter and I can never please my parents so I need all my self esteem from strangers like you! (Points at Sheldon) But he is worse!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ok, <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>! (Mimes the explosion of Leonard's brain)<br>
(Howard is recording; Penny is disgusted)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stop it! You cannot blow up my head with your mind!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then I'll <b title="accept sth even though it is not the best, or not what you really want">settle for</b> an <b title='a serious swelling in the wall of an artery'>aneurism</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stop it!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You hit me! You saw that he hit me!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Trying to blow up my head!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So it was working!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It wa... It was not! You're a <b title='idiot'>nutcase</b>!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We'll see about that! (Tries to blow up his head again) <b title='a warning'>Heads up</b>, you people in the front row! This is a splash zone!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stop! Stop it! (Hits him again) Quit it! (Holds Sheldon's hands and then pins hims against a wall)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is this usually how these physics things go?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Recording and smiling) More often than you think.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>You're lucky I didn't run you over.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that's not much of an apology but I'll take it.<br>
