<s>The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards across the room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Whatcha doing there? Working on a new plan to catch the <b title='Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as "The Coyote") and The Road Runner are a duo of characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_The_Road_Runner">Wiki</a>]'>roadrunner</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And this is a <b title='a schematic diagram or picture shows sth in a simple way'>schematic</b> for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What I'm doing here, is trying to determine when I'm going to die.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My family history factoring in <b title='long life'>longevity</b>, <b title='inclination or tendency'>propensity</b> for disease, et cetera.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What's KBB?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Killed by badger.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there's a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being <b title='passed from a parent to a child in their genes'>hereditary</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not true. The fight or <b title='escape'>flight</b> instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a <b title='very large and strong'>brawny</b> member of the weasel family. Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can always get a badger and find out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But seriously, even if I <b title='ignore sth or treat it as unimportant'>disregard</b> the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That long, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The earliest estimate of the <b title='a hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence will have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">Wiki</a>]'>singularity</b>, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>By this much.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='bad luck. also "tough luck"'>Tough break</b>. You want eggs?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't get it, Leonard. I'm going to miss so much, the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory">Wiki</a>]'>unified field theory</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">Wiki</a>]'>cold fusion</b>, the dogapus.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's a dogapus?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is somebody working on that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait a minute. You hate dogs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>What do we owe you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It came to $28.17. Let's say six bucks apiece.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Here you go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Never mind. I got it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you wanted me to pay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's no big deal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, no, no. You're right. We're not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to Howard, and Howard laughs) What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He said if he had <b title='↗lady parts'>woman parts</b>, he'd eat for free the rest of his life.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself. I'm a little low on cash.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm? How much you got?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How can you walk around with no money?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm cute. I <b title='manage to live or do a particular thing'>get by</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's okay, you can owe me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, six bucks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.<br>
<i>Penny</i>But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not for me. Thursday is now <b title='cauliflower, cabbage, cress, bok choy, broccoli, brussels sprouts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciferous_vegetables">Wiki</a>]'>Cruciferous Vegetable</b> Night. Tonight's selection, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprouts">Wiki</a>] ↗bean sprouts'>brussels sprouts</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a small price to pay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>For what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, don't ask.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>cybernetics</b>, I need to change my diet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Correct.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So you wanna turn yourself into some sort of robot?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Essentially, yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, here's my question. Didn't you already do that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Flattering, but sadly, no. I'm also planning to begin an exercise <b title='a special plan of food, exercise etc that is intended to improve your health ↗regime, regiment'>regimen</b> designed to strengthen my <b title='circulatory system [<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system">Wiki</a>]'>cardiovascular system</b>. <b title='also know as'>AKA</b> jogging.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a <b title='a medical condition in which a person&#039;s spine is curved from side to side [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis">Wiki</a>]'>scoliosis</b> test.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) You're right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it won't. Um, how does he know I jog?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, that is so creepy!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he's not gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently; to Raj) Then see a <b title='a psychoanalyst or psychiatrist'>shrink</b> and figure out how to talk to women.
<s>Leonard's bedroom</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell? What's the matter?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have pain radiating from my <b title='belly button'>navel</b> to my lower right abdomen. I'm <b title='↗throw up, puke, vomit'>nauseated</b> and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung%27s_disease">Wiki</a>]'>Hirschsprung's Disease</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism">Wiki</a>]'>botulism</b>, a 30-foot <b title='a long flat worm that lives in the intestines of humans and animals'>tapeworm</b> or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When would you've accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's part of an unlikely scenario that involves <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepwalking">Wiki</a>]'>sleepwalking</b> and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-<b title='giving careful attention to what is happening'>vigilant</b> <b title='owner'>proprietor</b>. Oh, Lord, my belly!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Have you had your appendix out?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I haven't. I've been meaning to, but who has the time?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let's get you to the hospital.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a <b title='having never developed completely or having almost disappeared'>vestigial</b> organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do. And yet I'm <b title='doom - make sb/sth certain to fail, die, be destroyed etc'>doomed</b> while you live on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Funny how things work out, isn't it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might've been the Brussels sprouts.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good night. <b title='a painful swelling of the appendix that can be very serious'>Appendicitis</b>. What a nervous <b title='silly person'>nelly</b>.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. They're my mother's.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. And the <b title='a fictional comic book superhero [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_%28comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>Flash</b> shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday, but it's nice when things work out. Where's your heart rate monitor?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't have one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What about your <b title='an instrument for measuring how far you have walked'>pedometer</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Don't have one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you have <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematics">Wiki</a>]'>telematics</b> in your shoes connected to an iPod?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you do, you just go out there and <b title='jump or run around in a lively active way ↗gamble'>gambol</b> about like a bunny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a <b title='a sweet breakfast pastry [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_claw_%28pastry%29">Wiki</a>]'>bear claw</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why are you doing that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's good to <b title='↗cramp, contraction, spasm, twist'>stretch</b> your muscles before you run.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, let's start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am doing it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We'll never know.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, let's just warm up on the run.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I've been reading up on <b title='the study of the structure and function of biological systems [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics">Wiki</a>]'>biomechanics</b>. I think you'll be surprised at my- Wah! Oh!<br>
<i>Penny</i>(squealing) Oh, my God, you okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, let me help you up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Sheldon!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Here's my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp <b title='a mixed rice dish from South Asia [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani">Wiki</a>]'>biryani</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you, sir.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='an North Indian cuisine dish [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palak_paneer">Wiki</a>]'>Palak paneer</b>, that's Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of <b title='a type of chicken product offered by McDonald&#039;s [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_McNuggets">Wiki</a>]'>chicken McNuggets</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, what's my share?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, 12 bucks.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What am I <b title='as a maximum number or amount'>up to</b> now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(After Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh) What now?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's just expressing his admiration that you don't even have to <b title='agree to have sex with sb'>put out</b> to get free stuff.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's not free, I'm gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers. Both laugh again) Shut up!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, are you gonna join us?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a T-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon's face, appears). Greetings, friends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Greetings, whatever the hell you are.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the <b title='changes and unexpected difficulties'>vicissitudes</b> of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) Really? That's your question? When did he put a <b title='slope joining two levels of ground, a floor, a road etc '>ramp</b> in?<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>(To Penny) You're in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you'll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>Thank you. That's what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you'll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This is ridiculous. I'm coming to talk to you.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>You don't know where I am. My physical body is safely <b title='ensconce - settle yourself in a place where you feel comfortable and safe'>ensconced</b> in a secure, <b title='not made known or told to anyone'>undisclosed</b> location.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're in your bedroom.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>No, I'm not.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom. (Goes to his bedroom)<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>No, you can't. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To Raj and Howard) So, either one of you weirdos wanna buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, this is ridiculous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm behind you. Please look at me when you're talking to me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I am looking at you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, you're not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>At my age, do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>At the hands of your roommate?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>An accident.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's how I'm gonna make it look.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine, but don't expect my help.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have to help, it's in the roommate agreement.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.<br>

<i>Sheldon-bot</i>This is delightful.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Refresh my memory. Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?<br>

Remember?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't wanna listen to music, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>Very well. I don't understand why you're not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we're like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider">Wiki</a>]'>Knight Rider</b>.<br>

<i>Sheldon-bot</i>You mock the sphincter, but, the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn't survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>Perhaps you'd be interested in a different game.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>This is a photograph of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_Conference">Wiki</a>]'>the 1911 Solvay Conference</b> on the theory of radiation and <b title='plural of quantum'>quanta</b>.

<i>Penny</i>I'd rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>Can you tell me the specials this evening?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>Obviously. I don't even have water yet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Because you're not here.<br>
<i>Sheldon-bot</i>That's discrimination against the otherwise located. I'm going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.<br>
