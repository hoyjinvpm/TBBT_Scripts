<i>Penny</i>Okay, it's done. Look, guys, for the future, I don't mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, please. We're facing a far more serious problem than <b title='lost'>stray</b> <b title='蛛形纲动物 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid">Wiki</a>]'>arachnids</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, it's not that bad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not bad? It's horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it will happen to you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So they steamed your dumplings. Get over it. New topic, please.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly <b title='gorgeous'>ravishing</b> today.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So there is a number.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. New topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5-A are moving out?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. Shh-shh-shh!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>The people upstairs are moving out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The horror.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would you just say something like that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>How else-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, no, no, no, no.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How else was I supposed to say it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Slowly. Like putting a new fish in a tank. You don't just drop it in. You let the bag sit in the water a while.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The horror.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I'm sure it's gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, it's not going to be fine. Change is never fine. They say it is, but it's not.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I never met them. That's what made them perfect. There were no awkward hellos in the halls. There's no clickety-clacking of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors. They may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape. And without that annoying ammonia-urine smell.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't know that. How can you possibly know that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're right, I can't. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now. An opera singer, the <b title='actors'>cast</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomp">Wiki</a>]'>Stomp</b>. (Leonard lies against the couch back in frustration) Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why are you making it worse?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I tried making it better, he wouldn't <b title='like'>go for</b> it.<br>
(Raj whispers something in Howard's ear)<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're right. That's a great idea.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother and we can all spend some more time together. (To Penny) If you catch my <b title='general meaning, gist'>drift</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The horror.
<s>Howard's porch.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hold on. Do you honestly expect me to believe that social <b title='rules of behavior'>protocol</b> <b title='dictate - control or influence how sth happens'>dictates</b> we break our backs helping Wolowitz move and then he only need buy us a pizza?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, that really is how it works.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj, help me out here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I knew it. PS3, definitely PS3. Who would pick a mountain bike?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Enough with the guilt, Ma. We'll still see each other. And I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I get it, you're angry. You don't wanna see your little bird leave the nest.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Little bird? You're almost 30! Fly for God's sake.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine, I'll stay. You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you're ruining my life!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(On phone) Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news, you can <b title='stop committing suicide [<a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/40978/meaning-of-the-idiom-keeping-my-head-out-of-the-oven">more</a>]'>take your head out of the oven</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Unties a waist support belt) I guess I won't be needing this.
<s>The ground floor of the apartment building. There are boxes on the floor. Two movers are moving a matress.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no. The new ones. They're here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stay calm. We don't know anything about them yet.<br>
(Sheldon rattles a box)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like <b title='a percussion instrument [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castanets">Wiki</a>] 响板'>castanets</b> to you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The box says "kitchen."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So? Do cocaine smugglers write "cocaine" on the box?<br>
<i>Woman</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>I'm Alicia. (Stretchs out her hand) I'm moving in upstairs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Shakes her hand) That is so great. Oh, I'm Leonard. I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you <b title='by itself'>per se</b>, but, under your apartment. Heh-heh.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>That's nice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it is.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that concludes your <b title='hesitant'>faltering</b> attempt to mate. (To Alicia) Hello.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello. On a scale of one to ten, how <b title='↗light footsteps'>light of foot</b> would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all, and ten being <b title='freakish - weird'>freakishly</b> <b title='looking like or moving like a cat'>feline</b>?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Freakishly feline?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We'll come back to that one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_%28dance%29">Wiki</a>]'>salsa</b>, Irish-folk or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-boying">Wiki</a>] 霹雳舞'>breakdancer</b>?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're making her uncomfortable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did-? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better, you're doing very well so far. Next question. Are you fertile?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>I have no immediate plans.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, <b title='supporting/approving'>pro</b> or con?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Pro?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alicia?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Welcome to the building.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Alicia</i>Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Carrying a big box) Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, this is Alicia, our new neighbor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm helping.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I can see.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She's still on <b title="testing of a person's abilities or behavior to find out if he or she is suitable">probation</b> of course, but I like her.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Cool T-shirt.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this. I'm going jogging.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't jog.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I can start.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>True. But the more likely explanation for your <b title='clothes'>attire</b> is that you're out of clean clothes again.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're welcome, Penny.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Please, you look cute. I'm dressed like a <b title='sb who is lazy and untidy'>slob</b> today too.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, ha, ha.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Still carrying the box) I think you look fantastic.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>This one's a player, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, be careful.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Thanks for the warning.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>I'll see you around.<br>
<i>Penny</i>See ya. (In mocking voice) "I'm dressed like a slob today too."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='↗imitate'>mimicry</b>. I enjoy mimicry. I've been working on <b title='The line "It&#039;s a trap!", which he says during a scene in Return of the Jedi, was one of the most popular lines from the Star Wars films and became a popular Internet meme. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Ackbar">Wiki</a>]'>Admiral Ackbar</b> from Return of the Jedi. It's a trap! You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. (Penny leaves without saying anything) It's a trap! It's a trap! It's a trap!
<s>The living room. Sheldon's sitting on the couch and writing something in the air. Someone knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Come.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, sort of.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How does one sort of-?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's upstairs at Alicia's.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, all right, that's cool, <b title='↗big deal'>no biggie</b>. He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, they're all up there, huh? Hmm. Typical.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's <b title='axiomatic - self-evident'>axiomatically</b> <b title='≠typical'>atypical</b>. Until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters in a previous location. They never went to visit the former tenants. So your characterization of their behavior as typical is <b title='demonstrable - able to be shown or proved'>demonstrably</b> <b title='wrong'>fallacious</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, now I see the giant squid head. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Frantically wipes the "board") Oh, great. Now I have to start all over again.
<s>Alicia's.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I'm really more of a downtown-<b title='a loft apartment refers to large adaptable open space, often converted for residential use (a converted loft) from some other use, often light industrial [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loft">Wiki</a>]'>loft</b> kind of guy.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Cool. So are you in a loft now?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, actually I'm living with a woman in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altadena,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Altadena</b>. Purely <b title='a relationship that is platonic is just friendly and is not a sexual relationship [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic">Wiki</a>]'>platonic</b>. She's also my <b title='woman servant'>maid</b>. Heh.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Sounds like a <b title='a very good business agreement/arrangement'>sweet deal</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I won't lie. It's pretty <b title='cool'>dope</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Appears) Hello?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Oh, hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift (Gives her a bottle of wine).<br>
<i>Alicia</i>That is so sweet.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Come on in. Let's open it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Great.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Nice dress.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I've never had such good-looking technical support. (Leonard smirks)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, <b title='nonsense, sth absurd'>pish posh</b>. (Raj whispers something in his ear) I don't know. It means <b title='thing of little value'>shucks</b>. (Raj does so again) Shucks means shucks. Let me go once in a while.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey uh, Penny, you wanna hear something awesome?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Alicia is an actress just like you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That is so awesome.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know, <b title='used to say that you understand what sb is talking about and have had the same experience'>tell me about it</b>.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>I've been out here three months and all I've gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's why I work at The Cheesecake Factory. I'm <b title='to not accept anything less than you have asked for'>holding out for</b> the right <b title='role'>part</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound">Wiki</a>]'>5.1 Dolby or DTS</b>?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Whatever you think is best, <b title='sb who is attractive or kind'>cutie</b>. (Leonard giggles; Penny is upset)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, DTS has more <b title='bass [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_%28sound%29">Wiki</a>]'>low-end</b>, so, okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this. I read the best science joke on the Internet. Alicia, you won't get it, but it's <b title="ideally suited to their interests or abilities">right up their alley</b>. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream <b title='shop, store'>parlor</b> every week and orders an <b title='a tall glass of ice cream with whipped cream and nuts or fruit on top [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundae">Wiki</a>]'>ice cream sundae</b> for himself and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing. The man says, "Well, I'm a physicist and (slowly) <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Wiki</a>]'>quantum mechanics</b> teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me." The owner then says, "Well, lots of single beautiful women come in here every day. Why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?" And the physicist says: "Yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?" Ha. (The guys are upset)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's a little insulting, don't you think?<br>
<i>Penny</i>How would I know? I'm not even sure I get it.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Hey, Leonard? If you're done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, I'd love to.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, maybe when you're done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised, a week ago?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't <b title='scold or criticize continuously'>nag</b> me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Downs a drink) Hello, there.
<s>The living room. Shelon's sitting on the couch watching TV. Penny enters and then collapses on the couch dejectedly.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who is it? Oh, hello, Penny. It's open. Come in. Sarcasm.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, they're all still up there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You think I can't hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. It's Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't even know why I care. I don't care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, Penny, there's something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either <b title='start a business etc in a particular place'>locate</b> to a new hive, or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you saying? That I'm threatened by Alicia? That I'm like the old queen of the hive, and it's just time for me to go?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm just talking about bees. They're on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Channel">Wiki</a>]'>the Discovery Channel</b>. What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bees. (Gasps) I just got that physicist joke.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm-hm.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, what's the occasion?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No occasion. Just felt like getting some Chinese <b title='food'>chow</b> for my <b title='peep - person; sb who watches sb else having sex'>peeps</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Even though the menu description specifies shredded?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='whole grain rice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rice">Wiki</a>]'>Brown rice</b>, not white?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. See how it's done, Leonard? (Leonard is upset)<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what do we got going on tonight? Huh? Playing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_%28series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Halo</b>?

<i>Howard</i>No, no, <b title='Premenstrual syndrome [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome">Wiki</a>]'>PMS</b> is different.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Thank God you're home. I need help.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>I just got a callback to audition for <b title='Crime Scene Investigation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation">Wiki</a>]'>CSI</b> to play a hooker who gets killed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'd watch that.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>But my car is in the <b title='↗garage'>shop</b> and I have to be at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios">Wiki</a>]'>Universal</b> in 45 minutes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, I'll take you.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Oh, you're a lifesaver.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll run <b title='line - words that an actor say in a play etc'>lines</b> with you in the car.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Great. And afterward, I'll take you all out for Chinese.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, actually, that's okay. We already have-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yum!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Starving. (They leave)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Chinese food right here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They're gone, Penny. They can't hear you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go <b title='pant - breathe quickly with short breaths'>panting</b> after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Orange County</b> to pick up her TV?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='used when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared'>Apples and oranges here</b>, Sheldon. <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, that girl is a user, skating through life on her looks, taking advantage of <b title='knowing nothing of evil or wrong; foolishly simple ↗naive'>innocent</b> weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows.

<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Guess what? I got the part on CSI.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, <b title='used for exclamation'>boy</b>.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Something wrong?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, no, no no no. You know, congratulations. I think you'll <b title='have the qualities that are necessary for a particular job, use, or purpose'>make</b> a great hooker.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Thank you. Hey, I gotta ask you something. How much do physicists make?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, Ah. I don't know. I don't think a lot.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Yeah, that's what I figured. Well, gotta run. The guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey. Hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>About what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you know, it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren't like other guys. They're special.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Okay, they're special, and?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Let's see. How can I explain this. Um, They don't know how to use their shields.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Shields?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you know, like in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Wiki</a>]'>Star Trek</b> when you're in battle, you raise the shields? (To herself) Where the hell'd that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are. So, please don't take advantage of them.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>Who says I'm taking advantage of them?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, they're doing everything for you because you're <b title='lead on - deceive sb, esp to make them think you love them'>leading them on</b>.<br>
<i>Alicia</i>So I let them do stuff for me. They're happy, I get stuff. Who cares? And how is it any different from what you do?<br>
<i>Penny</i>'Scuse me?<br>
<i>Alicia</i>I've seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, lady, you are way out of line.<br>
