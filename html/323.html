<s>On the roof of the apartment building.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, we've got power to the laser.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I should've brought an umbrella.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What for? It's not gonna rain.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's a bazinga, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>One of my best, don't you think?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, do you wanna double-check the <b title='a mount for instruments that follows the rotation of the sky [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_mount">Wiki</a>]'>equatorial mount</b> on the laser? We need it locked onto the <b title='a lunar mare [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Tranquillitatis">Wiki</a>]'>Sea of Tranquility</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don't have to peep through windows.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's not like that, I'm watching someone's TV. <b title='an American television legal and political drama [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Wife">Wiki</a>]'>The Good Wife</b> is on. I tell you, this is my new <b title='an American medical drama television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy">Wiki</a>]'>Grey's Anatomy</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Relax, it's just a dirty sock.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not my world.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you know who'd really <b title='like'>dig</b> seeing this experiment? Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wasn't aware that <b title='measures the distance between the Earth and the Moon [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">Wiki</a>]'>lunar ranging</b> was her thing. Although, I suppose the <b title='back, backwards'>retro</b>-reflector left on the moon by <b title='That&#039;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong">Wiki</a>]'>Neil Armstrong</b> does qualify as a <b title='↗diamond, rhinestone'>shiny object</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why don't you ask her to come up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know, it's still a little weird since, you know-<br>
<i>Howard</i>She dumped you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, it's very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don't leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='fuck'>Screw</b> you guys. I'm gonna go see if she's home.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Raj, who's looking through the telescope) If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to point this at the moon now.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something's very wrong.
<s>Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hi. What's going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry, what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's pretty cool. We've got a two-meter <b title='a reflective surface used to collect or project energy such as light, sound, or radio waves [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_reflector">Wiki</a>] ↗dish'>parabolic reflector</b> and everything. I thought you might wanna see it.<br>
<i>Man in Penny's Apartment</i>That makes no sense.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um-<br>
<i>Man</i>How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There's no gravity.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Maybe another time.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, maybe.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, but what about the party?<br>
<i>Zack</i>It's a surprise party, doesn't matter when we get there.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how'd you two guys meet?<br>
<i>Zack</i>My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Your company?<br>
<i>Zack</i>Well, my dad, but me and my sister are <b title='vice presidents'>VPs</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, menus.<br>
<i>Zack</i>I know it sounds easy but there's a lot of science that goes in designing them.
<s>The roof.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Whoa! Is that the laser? It's <b title='excellent'>bitching</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitching.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Well, mission accomplished.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let me explain what we're doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're gonna shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this <b title='extremely sensitive detectors of light [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier">Wiki</a>]'>photomultiplier</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh! That's very cool.<br>
<i>Zack</i>One question. How can you be sure it won't blow up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The laser?<br>
<i>Zack</i>The moon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See, now this is a man for Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, that's a great question, Zack.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, it's not.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon! Play nice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well it's not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon? That's a great question.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to <b title='make a person or an animal unconscious by a blow ↗anaesthesia'>stun</b>.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Smart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Naked.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Preparing to fire laser at the moon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Make it so.<br>
<i>Howard</i>There it is. There's the <b title='fast, short duration electrical transients in voltage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_spike">Wiki</a>]'>spike</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='(2.5 / 2) * 300000 km = 375000 km'>2.5 seconds</b> for the light to return. That's the moon! We hit the moon!<br>
<i>Zack</i>That's your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.<br>
<i>Zack</i>What species is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was wrong. Penny can do better.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, just keep walking.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He must be very skilled at <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b>.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the <b title='↗hooker, prostitute, tramp'>whores</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Horse.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>The phrase is <b title='attempt the same challenging action after failure'>get back on the horse</b>, not whores.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's <b title='fuck horses'>disgusting</b>, dude.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, it's not... Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can<b title='turn on - cause to become interested'> turn you on</b> to this great new dating site I found.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, thanks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Have they found a match for you?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='lots'>Tons</b>. I've had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, let me restate that. It's very heavy, and I don't want to.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll help you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, right.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Wiki</a>]'>Frankenstein's monster</b> was lonely and he found a wife.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He didn't find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, we'll call that plan B.
<s>The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Coming!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Damn you, you <b title='an extreme bastard'>rat bastard</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you drunk?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How did I ruin him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>'Cause <b title='a long time ago ↗yesteryear, yore'>in the olden days</b>, I never would've known he was so stupid.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, he wasn't that stupid.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, yeah, he's stupid.<br>
<i>Penny</i>He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word <b title='↗appetite, tease'>appe-teasers</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How is that my fault?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where are we going?<br>
<i>Penny</i>We're gonna have sex.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why? I mean, okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Comes out of his bedroom) What's going on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, 'cause it's gonna get loud.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! Not this again.
<s>The next morning.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(After drinking some juice) In what universe is this low-<b title='soft fleshy inner part of fruit, flesh'>pulp</b>? Good morning, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You have eyes in the back of your head?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I'm making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, sorry about that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, God. That I've heard on multiple occasions. (Takes out a slice of toast from the toaster) In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How many times have I asked you not to do that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Counting this instance? 317.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where's Penny?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wonder why she didn't say goodbye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To a jar of <b title='a butter substitute [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can%27t_Believe_It%27s_Not_Butter!">Wiki</a>]'>I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!</b>) I have no difficulty believing you're not butter.
<s>Penny's door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I'll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, it must've been. I just threw up in my closet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='sth that is annoying or disappointing'>Bummer</b>. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Doesn't have to be tonight. I'm free <b title='almost'>pretty much</b> always.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, last night was a mistake.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, I'm sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's pretty well <b title='imprint - become fixed in your mind or memory so that you never forget'>imprinted</b> on my brain. Especially the whole <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo">Wiki</a>]'>rodeo</b> thing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, that's it? <b title='used to express the idea that sth very unexpected suddenly happens'>Wham, bam</b>, thank you, Leonard?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't you please let it go?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.<br>
<i>Mrs Gunderson</i>Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Holy crap.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Raj</i>The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're kidding. An actual woman?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Since when?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do you know what he's talking about?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nope. Why don't you ask him?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Leonard, what are you talking about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't wanna talk about it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That was a <b title='awful, terrible, useless'>lousy</b> suggestion.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, <b title='↗peer'>fellow</b> <b title='a living thing such as a plant or animal'>life-form</b>...
<s>A hallway.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can't do it.<br>
<i>Leslie Winkle</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Leonard Hofstadter. What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, I know! It's been a while!<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yeah, 18 months.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Right. So how you doing?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Fine. You?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, do you, uh, wanna do that again?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>What happened? <b title='a person with blond hair'>Blondie</b> dumped you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have <b title='relating to things people do in their spare time to relax ↗hobby, pastime, leisure, refreshing '>recreational</b> sex with them.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what do you say?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Let me think about it. (Slams door.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's not coming back. (Leaves)
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not us. Him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes, but him doesn't even know about her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, him about to find out about her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? Us gonna tell him?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who's going to tell whom about what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon. Hey.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your surprise confuses me. I live here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Be more specific.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Four thirty.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not afternoon. That's preevning.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I'm fairly certain it will <b title='become popular or fashionable'>catch on</b> as it fills a desperate need.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, tomorrow's Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so, I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would <b title='force air out through the nostrils with a loud noise'>snort</b> in <b title='contempt, disdain'>derision</b> and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant <b title='silly behavior'>tomfoolery</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But it's true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete <b title='nonsense'>hokum</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And that's exactly the answer we gave to the question, "what is your attitude towards online dating".<br>
<i>Raj</i>Howard wanted to write <b title='technical language that is difficult to understand and seems to have no sense ↗jargon'>mumbo jumbo</b>, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, come on, where's your scientific curiosity?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, most of it is being applied to <b title='unravel - understand or explain sth that is mysterious or complicated'>unravelling</b> the secrets of the universe while the rest of it's wondering why I'm having this conversation with you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, how about this. Even <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock">Wiki</a>]'>Spock</b> had a date once every seven years.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He didn't date. It was <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pon_farr">Wiki</a>]'>pon farr</b>. His blood boiled with mating <b title='strong sexual desire'>lust</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, well, why don't you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't drink coffee.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, you can have a hot chocolate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is <b title='no longer important'>moot</b>. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's life without <b title='a way of thinking, behaving, or doing something that is unusual, strange, and often amusing'>whimsy</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I'm out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there, forever.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're bluffing.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you willing to risk it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Curse you.

<i>Leonard</i>Thirty feet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you drunk?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on. We're gonna have sex, and it's not gonna mean a thing!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you out of your mind?! (Pushes him out)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.

<i>Sheldon</i>In a few minutes, when I <b title="show that you are happy about your own success or sb else's failure, in an unpleasant way">gloat</b> over the failure of this <b title='sth that is attempted or undertaken (esp if it requires boldness or courage) ↗endeavor'>enterprise</b>, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic <b title='An exclamation typically used to taunt, ridicule, or boast'>neener</b>-neener? Or just my normal look of <b title='behaving in a proud unfriendly way'>haughty</b> derision?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You don't know we're wrong yet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Haughty derision it is.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the <b title='too ready to believe what other people tell you'>gullible</b> and the lonely. Additionally, I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.<br>
<i>Amy</i>If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your <b title='a strong feeling of not liking'>aversion</b> to <b title='soil - make sth dirty'>soiled</b> <b title='a general word for tights, stockings, or socks, used in shops and in the clothing industry'>hosiery</b>. In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't object to the concept of a <b title='God'>deity</b>, but I'm <b title='baffle - puzzle'>baffled</b> by the notion of one that takes attendance.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know, that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I buy you a beverage?<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='slightly warm, lukewarm'>Tepid</b> water, please. (They go to the counter in unison)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good God, what have we done?
