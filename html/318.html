<i>Raj</i>Okay in <b title='a 2009 American epic science fiction film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%282009_film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Avatar</b> when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their <b title='the male genitalia'>junk</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, so?<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's your point?<br>
<i>Raj</i>My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I'd be very nervous around <b title='a Canadian film director, film producer, deep-sea explorer, screenwriter, and editor who has directed the two biggest box office films of all time. The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Titanic, Avatar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron">Wiki</a>]'>James Cameron</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn't <b title='He gained worldwide fame and became a cultural icon for his portrayal of Captain James Tiberius Kirk, commander of the Federation starship USS Enterprise, in the science fiction television series Star Trek, from 1966 to 1969; Star Trek: The Animated Series from 1973 to 1974, and in seven of the subsequent Star Trek feature films from 1979 to 1994. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shatner">Wiki</a>]'>William Shatner</b> in the new Star Trek movie?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's <b title='honorary head of some universities'>Chancellor</b>'s Award for Science.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you want to <b title='keep reminding sb in an unkind way'>rub my nose</b> in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I'll play. What self-important, <b title='preen - spend time making yourself look tidier and more attractive'>preening</b> fraud are they honoring this year?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I won?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You won.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It's not astonishing, more like inevitable. I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I'm gonna conduct an interview with myself and post it online.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, good for him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an <b title='self-esteem'>ego</b> boost.
<s>The apartment. The guys are watching Avatar in 3D. All are wearing 3D glasses except Raj.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Didn't it look like that spear was gonna go right through your skull?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you didn't want a <b title='a frozen flavored drink sold by the 7-Eleven company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurpee">Wiki</a>]'>Slurpee</b> at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Phone rings) Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call (To Howard) three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don't want to <b title='lose sth or have sth taken away from you'>forfeit</b> the award? Well, you've got that <b title='ie every loose end up in a neat little bow - to be sure and take care of all the details because they also are important'>tied up in a neat little bow</b>. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can't give a speech.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, no, you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can't do is shut up.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why <b title='an avocado-based dip [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guacamole">Wiki</a>]'>guacamole</b> turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, to you, is a large crowd?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Any group big enough to <b title='crush or harm sth by treading on it ↗tramp, stamp, stomp'>trample</b> me to death. General <b title='a practical and approximate way of doing or measuring sth'>rule of thumb</b> is 36 adults or 70 children.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, 'cause of your award, not because a <b title='a boy or man who removes dirty dishes from the tables in a restaurant'>busboy</b> sneezed on it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not accepting the award.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honor in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a <b title='a series of full-size pickup trucks [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_F-Series">Wiki</a>]'>Ford F-150</b> as a member of the Corn Queen's <b title='the court - a king or queen, together with their family and their servants, advisers, etc'>court</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. Yeah, I'll bear that in mind if I'm ever nominated for the <b title='an insulting word meaning an uneducated poor person who lives in the mountains ↗redneck'>Hillbilly</b> Peace Prize.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Am I? Let me tell you a story.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Where's 70 children when you need <b title='them'>'em</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honors.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was <b title='the student in a high school who has the best grades, and usu makes a speech at a graduation ceremony'>valedictorian</b> and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the <b title='a small platform that a person stands on when giving a speech or conducting an orchestra etc'>podium</b> and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to <b title='hyper + ventilate ↗ventilation'>hyperventilate</b>. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it- oh, dear. (He faints.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't trample me.
<s>The stairwell. Sheldon is on the phone.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Come on, Mother, you know why I can't accept the award. With all due respect, I don't think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't need to start singing it. Yes, I'll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Goodbye, Mother. (Enters apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.) Hello.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sit down, we wanna talk to you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just sit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We think we can help you with your stage fright.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I doubt that. I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm sorry, that is what I meant.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, your problem is, you're trying to do this all by yourself.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do like the X-Men.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Did I see X-Men?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know. If you're my X-Men, what are your powers?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Well, I am gonna take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not exactly a <b title='a change in the genetic structure of an animal or plant that makes it different from others of the same kind ↗mutant'>mutation</b> that would get you into Xavier's School for Gifted <b title='youngster - a young person/child'>Youngsters</b>, but, go on. Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding <b title='Codependent relationships are a type of dysfunctional helping relationship where one person supports or enables another person&#039;s addiction, poor mental health, immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency">Wiki</a>]'>co-dependently</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don't know, some Indian meditation crap.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. <b title='make sb feel strong admiration'>Dazzle</b> me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>My power is the ability to pretend like I <b title='to not care at all'>give a damn</b> about your <b title='shitty, small, unimportant, lame, or dull'>piddly-ass</b> problems. And that's 24-7, buddy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I appreciate the pretence.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my <b title='↗semen'>C-Men</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, that's not a good name.
<s>The apartment. Raj is lighting candles. Indian music is playing.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, Sheldon. I'm going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient <b title='guru - a Hindu religious teacher or leader; respected and influential teacher or authority'>gurus</b> of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And yet, you can't speak to women.<br>
<i>Raj</i>True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, but don't punch me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you'll get a surprise, and then she'd punch me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not going to punch you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's what my sister used to say.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do you want to do this or not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. Proceed.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='an open-ended city-building computer and console video game series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">Wiki</a>]'>SimCity</b>. More specifically, the SimCity I designed, <b title='↗Indianapolis, metropolis'>Sheldonopolis</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Whatever you like.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? This time of year? It's a bit <b title='cold'>nippy</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Then, put on a sweater.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You own the damn thing. Just take a <b title='fucking'>freaking</b> sweater!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look, I didn't <b title='achieve'>turn</b> a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves <b title='in a careless way without planning'>willy-nilly</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right. You've paid for a sweater, and you're in Sheldon Square.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hang on. It's a <b title='↗jumper, pullover'>cardigan</b>. I have to button it. Oh, no.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can't run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but <b title='nonsense'>hokum</b>.
<s>A clothing store.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I question your <b title='a statement or an idea that forms the basis for a reasonable line of argument'>premise</b>. How is a new suit going to prevent me from <b title='pass out - faint'>passing out</b> in front of a ballroom full of people?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It'll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that's when I buy shoes. Now, let's see what we've got. Ooh! This is nice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's only one color.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's a lot of money for only one color.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine. Why don't you pick out what you like.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a <b title='loud clothes are too bright or have too many bright patterns'>loud</b> <b title='a pattern of squares'>check</b> suit). This is pretty <b title='attractive and fashionable ↗smart, stylish'>sharp</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you're wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Now in a sparkly green suit with <b title='rhinestone - an artificial jewel made of clear glass'>rhinestones</b>) This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. (Cut to Sheldon exiting in a white dinner suit with tails) Okay, I think we have a winner.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Where the hell d'you find that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In the prom department.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's ridiculous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Please just try this one on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. But anything I put on now is only gonna suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a clown.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So, Sheldon, how you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my <b title='Bologna sausage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_sausage">Wiki</a>]'>baloney</b> at <b title='a major supermarket chain in the Southern California area [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralphs">Wiki</a>]'>Ralphs</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, I'll start again.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, I don't know, maybe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was wearing <b title='the average pants size for most men in the US is actually between 38 to 40 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_sizes">Clothing sizes</a>]'>size a million pants</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why don't we just talk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, the talking cure. Classical <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Wiki</a>]'>Freudian</b>, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard <b title='a psychological test in which subjects&#039; perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation. It has been reported that popular responses on the first card include bat, badge and coat of arms. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">Wiki</a>]'>Rorschach ink blot test</b> are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a <b title='syringe'>hypodermic</b> needle.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why don't I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting <b title='accolade - praise or an award for an achievement that people admire'>accolades</b> if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really, Leonard? You're just going to try to <b title='use sth such as an idea, writing etc again instead of developing something new'>recycle</b> <b title='An inferiority complex is a lack of self-worth, a doubt and uncertainty, and feelings of not measuring up to standards. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferiority_complex">Wiki</a>]'>Adler's doctrine of the inferiority complex</b>? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's. And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, "Do <b title='[<a href="Lima Bean">Wiki</a>]'>Lima Beans</b> Grow Better to Classical Music." But, uh, my mother pointed out that it was just a <b title='sth that uses old ideas as if they were new'>rehash</b> of my brother's earlier "Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock 'n' Roll." I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And how did that make you feel?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown's <b title='a song that is sung by only one person in an opera'>aria</b> from <b title='an Italian opera [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagliacci">Wiki</a>]'>Pagliacci</b> to a lima bean sprout.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It wasn't my fault. I had never seen my brother's project. And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Damn right, I'm angry with my mother. For God's sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That's when the bed-wetting started again.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, that's it? I thought we had a whole hour!
<s>The award ceremony.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honor to introduce the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother, who couldn't be here tonight. Isn't that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She's proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That's what she calls him. Shelly, it's a <b title='a special name you call sb who you like very much ↗nickname'>pet name</b>. You know what my mother's pet name for me is? Leonard. But I <b title='turn or wander in speech or writing'>digress</b>. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of- (continues as background noise)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm getting dizzy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't worry. You're surrounded by your C-Men.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't do this. I'm going to faint.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here, drink this. It'll relax you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine, faint.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Downs the glass) I don't feel different, this alcohol's defective.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here, see if this one works.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Still talking) First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me. If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm ready.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honor, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thanks, <b title='a short person'>shorty</b>,I'll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus">Wiki</a>]'>differential calculus</b> and at least one year of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology">Wiki</a>]'>algebraic topology</b>? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">Wiki</a>]'>Mobius strip</b>? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no <b title='electricity / the amount of money you have to pay for goods or services'>charge</b>.

<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I'm having about the events of last night?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Question one, where are my pants?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You might wanna check YouTube.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do I search?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's already loaded. Just hit play.<br>
<i>On-screen Sheldon</i>All right, people, let's get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body's in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Lord, this couldn't be any more humiliating.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-uh, give it a minute.<br>
