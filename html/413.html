<i>Penny</i>Hey. So you guys ready to order?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing, and it's now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other <b title='absurd'>nonsensical</b> queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry, I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Probably serving food that was ordered today.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That's too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of <b title='involving different areas of knowledge or study'>Interdisciplinary</b> Studies' <b title='small conference for discussion of a particular subject ↗seminar'>symposium</b> on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's an annual science conference. We've all been invited to speak.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='used when you wish a situation was different, and you feel sad or disappointed'>Shame</b>. Since you're my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm your best friend?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't you read my blog?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's, and I used to sleep with him.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in <b title='a sparsely populated region of the Central Coast of California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sur">Wiki</a>]'>Big Sur</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I really, I'm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think her weekend just opened up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, it is going to be difficult, but I'm gonna cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Please don't touch my breasts.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I, I wasn't going to.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right. I just wanna establish boundaries.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don't <b title='annoy very much'>piss off</b> the people who handle the things you eat.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That does seem to be a <b title='logical'>valid</b> principle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers' Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't believe there's any such thing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Leonard) You lied to me?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good morning. If I could have everyone's attention, please? I know we're all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I'm sure we can get through this <b title='a period of time during which people are trained and prepared for a new job or course of study'>orientation</b> in under a half an hour. Then it's just Q&A, quiz, safety <b title='drill - procedures to be followed in an emergency'>drills</b>, pose for <b title='produced for an important event to help you remember it'>commemorative</b> group photo and we're off.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Penny) Don't worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Raj is getting himself a cup of coffee) Raj? What are you doing? I don't think so. You've had your <b title='↗allocate'>allotted</b> <b title='6 * 30 ml'>six ounces</b>. The first bathroom break isn't until the Denny's located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we're only as strong as our weakest bladder.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) Nobody cares about your <b title='repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise">Wiki</a>]'>Kegel exercises</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yay!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She <b title='make out a case for sth - give arguments in favor of sth'>made the case</b> that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska <b title='a place that is away from any big towns and from the influence of modern life'>backwoods</b> skills and <b title='very large and strong'>brawny</b> hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Brawny?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They're bigger than mine.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Voice) Fine. Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's eleven fifteen. I'm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Still right behind you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, Amy, I've been wondering, are you and Sheldon gonna be sharing a room?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, we discussed it. We decided we didn't wanna jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Indeed. Nothing <b title="if a relationship or sb's attitude sours, or if sth sours it, it becomes unfriendly or unfavorable">sours</b> a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can <b title='say that you believe that sth is true'>vouch for</b> that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not you, him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Thanks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Although yours was an <b title='an experience from which you learn sth surprising or new'>eye-opener</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't worry, Penny. You're my plus-one. You'll <b title='a narrow bed that is attached to the wall, for example on a train or ship / sleep'>bunk</b> with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I'm the ideal hotel roommate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Terrific. Are we there yet?
<s>Bernadette's car.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>I hope we get there in time to see the <b title='the central idea of a book, a speech etc'>keynote</b> address.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? You wanna see the keynote?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global <b title='the last book in the Bible, recording the revelation of St John about the end of the world / the destruction of the world'>apocalypse</b> or exciting research opportunity?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Really? And miss the keynote?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We can watch it later on <b title='Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN">Wiki</a>]'>C-SPAN</b>. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well honey, if you're that tired, why don't you just take a nap here in the car?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, see, it's not-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hang on. It's Leonard. Hi, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Voice) Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh. Thank you, Raj.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you an element in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinide">Wiki</a>]'>actinoid series</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. Amy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanide">Wiki</a>]'>lanthanoid series</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy, it's Penny's turn. Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, I don't know. Are you food?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not <b title='appropriate or relevant to what is being said or done'>apropos</b>. We've already established I'm found in the periodic table.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I knew she wasn't lead car material.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who elected you Road Trip God?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to <b title='a parliamentary procedure where debate is extended, allowing one or more members to delay or entirely prevent a vote on a given proposal. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster">Wiki</a>]'>filibuster</b>. It's not technically Road Trip God, it's Travel Supervisor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Although Road Trip God does <b title='have a ring to it - sound interesting or attractive'>have a certain ring to it</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, I don't understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What's he gonna do?
<s>Bernadette's car.</s>
<i>Penny</i>I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Don't worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. It's the Love Car.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To Raj) Should I ask? (He shakes his head)<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>(Singing) They say we're young and we don't know, we won't find out until we grow.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Singing) Well, I don't know if all that's true, 'cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.<br>
<i>Together</i>(Singing) Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…<br>
<i>Penny</i>Red Leader, I'm really sorry.
<s>The hotel.</s>
<i>Howard & Bernadette</i>(Singing) I got you, babe.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I missed you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what? I missed you, too.<br>
<i>Very tall and powerfully built man</i>Bernadette?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, my God, Glenn! (They hug)<br>
<i>Glenn</i>Great to see you!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Are you here for the conference?<br>
<i>Glenn</i>Yeah, I'm doing a global warming <b title='group'>panel</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.<br>
<i>Glenn</i>Oh. Nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hi. (They shakes hands) Ow. Hi.<br>
<i>Glenn</i>You're a lucky man. Bernie's a great gal.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. Bernie sure is.<br>
<i>Glenn</i>Well, I gotta run. The panel's tomorrow morning. It's called, Remembering Snow: A Look Back.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'll try to catch it.<br>
<i>Glenn</i>Oh, great. Bye.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Bernie?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please tell me he's your gay cousin.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No. He was one of my professors in college.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh! That's a relief.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Then we went out for a year. Come on, let's check in, so we can take that nap.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) No, it's not necessarily <b title='penis length to height'>proportional</b>. Shut up!
<s>Howard's hotel room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>That green bag is Dr. Cooper's. Here's an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i><b title='200.66 cm'>Six-seven</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Is something bothering you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. It's just-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there's nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, it's not a contest. I love you. I wanna to be with you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn't have a chance, right?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You can't think that way.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep. Loser.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, stop it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wait a minute, a girl like me? What's that mean?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm- I-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Are you saying you don't think I'm hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No! No, I'm saying exactly the opposite.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, let's go with that.

<i>Amy</i>(Exiting bathroom) Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.<br>

<i>Penny</i>Um, I never really thought about it. Why?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Not for sex, for convenience. You can't deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Again, I've never given it much thought.<br>
<i>Amy</i>We have time now. Think about it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Knock on door) Oh, good. Hey.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Can I stay here tonight?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Why, what happened?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard's a complete and total <b title='stupid person'>ass</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Thanks. I'll sleep on the floor.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We are?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Of course, we're best friends.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, right, right, the blog.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Word of warning, though. I'm prone to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror">Wiki</a>]'>night terrors</b>, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.
<s>Leonard's room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, can I stay here tonight?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon's asleep. What's going on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, Howard's a complete and total ass, Bernadette's in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Never mind. Can I stay here or not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, sure.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, how do you wanna do this?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it is a little like getting into <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula">Wiki</a>]'>Dracula</b>'s coffin.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We're just gonna have to make the best of this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, when you say make the best of it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sleep.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. So we'll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, okay. Just like old times.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary <b title='an agreement between enemies or opponents to stop fighting for an agreed period of time'>truce</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Go to sleep.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please tell me you're not having coitus.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We are not having coitus.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night?
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>

<i>Raj</i>Oh, my God, I'm crying already.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raj? Raj? Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay. Come on in.

<i>Penny</i>Leonard, are you asleep?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, no problem.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know it's kinda weird.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='an expression of affirmation'>True dat</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>True dat?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've gotten a lot more street since we broke up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right. Still mad at me about that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've gotten a lot better at that, you know. I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to <b title='↗rape, ravish'>violate</b> the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Enters) Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny's here. (Raj whispers to him) No, we don't wanna watch Bridget Jones's Diary!
<s>A conference room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, <b title='Bachelor of Science'>BS</b>, <b title='Master of Science'>MS</b>, <b title='Master of Arts'>MA</b>, <b title='Doctor of Philosophy'>PhD</b>, and <b title='Scientiae Doctor (Doctor of Science).'>ScD</b>. <b title='Oh My God'>OMG</b>, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too <b title='rejecting conventional practices or behaviour in a way perceived to be vague and unconsidered or foolishly idealistic [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">Hippie</a>]'>hippy-dippy</b> for this crowd. All right then, we'll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science's responsibility to society?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It's not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still <b title='rip (one) a new asshole, verbally attack sb'>tear you a new one</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I'd like to <b title='join in an argument or fight'>weigh in</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dr. Koothrappali, <b title='used to ask sb politely'>would you care to</b> join the conversation?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Certainly. I'd like to <b title='bring sth up for discussion or attention, put forward'>raise</b> two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these <b title='a cocktail made of champagne and orange juice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosa_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>mimosas</b> are <b title='kick ass - perform well'>kicking my little brown ass</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'd like to kick your little brown ass.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What did I do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I did. You said no Bridget Jones.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Voice) We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. We-we're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, shut up, Sheldon!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hi, bestie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let me ask you something, Bernie.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I guess not.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie">Wiki</a>]'>Angelina Jolie</b>?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'd like to weigh in here. No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, why don't we open it up to Q&A from the audience?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?<br>
<i>Glenn</i>I'm driving back to L.A. tonight.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Um, Penny, that's Glenn. Glenn, that's Penny.<br>

<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Must be out of range.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Leonard, can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. Why do you ask?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Because we're going 120 miles per hour.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, if no one's going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.
