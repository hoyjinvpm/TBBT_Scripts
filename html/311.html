<i>Penny</i>Oh, I always tear up when <b title='Dr. Seuss&#039; How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (promoted theatrically as The Grinch) is a 2000 American fantasy comedy Christmas film. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27_How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_%28film%29">Wiki</a>]'>the Grinch's heart grows three sizes</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy">Wiki</a>]'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</b>, is a serious disease which could lead to <b title='a medical condition where a part of the body becomes blocked'>congestive</b> heart failure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Singing <b title='a traditional Christmas and New Years&#039; carol [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_the_Halls">Wiki</a>]'>Deck the Halls</b>) Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You really didn't like it, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, on the contrary. I-I found the Grinch to be a <b title='relate - form a sympathetic or significant relationship'>relatable</b>, <b title='pleasant and attracting your interest'>engaging</b> character, and I was really <b title='support'>with</b> him right up to the point that he <b title='succumb - give in, cave in'>succumbed</b> to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a <b title='sb who ruins a positive moment for everyone else'>buzz kill</b> that was.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When we watch <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosty_the_Snowman_(TV_program)">Wiki</a>]'>Frosty the Snowman</b>, he <b title='root for - support'>roots for</b> the sun.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural <b title='small cheap things that people use in their ordinary life'>ephemera</b> in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never <b title='bring/call sb to account - force sb who is responsible for a mistake or a crime to explain publicly why they did it and punish them for it if necessary'>brought to account</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mmm, in my family, holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their <b title='anthropology - the scientific study of people, their societies, cultures etc'>anthropological</b> and psychological implications on human society.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and <b title='critique - express your opinion about sth after examining and judging it carefully and in detail'>critiqued</b> each other.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a <b title='a long open box that horses and cows can eat from'>manger</b>, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more <b title='lively and enjoyable'>jolly</b>, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide <b title='seizure - the act of forcibly dispossessing an owner of property'>seizures</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So I <b title='suppose, assume'>take it</b> you don't wanna help us trim the tree.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do not. But, if you insist on decorating a <b title='if insects, rats etc infest a place, there are a lot of them and they usually cause damage.'>spider-infested</b> fire <b title='sth that may be dangerous'>hazard</b> in my home, I would request that you add this.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're kidding, right? It's a <b title="sculpture of a person's head, shoulders and chest">bust</b> of Sir Isaac Newton.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, excuse me, but it's much more Christmassy than anything you've put on the tree.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='said when sth bad starts happening again'>Here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>December 25, 1642, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Wiki</a>]'>Julian calendar</b>, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional <b title='≠Christian'>pagan</b> holiday that celebrated <b title='the day of the year with the fewest hours of daylight'>the winter solstice</b> with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Merry Newton-mas, everyone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it's fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, he doesn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I understand. You <b title='say that sth is not correct or true'>dispute</b> Newton's claim that he invented <b title='↗differential, integral'>calculus</b> and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz</b> on the top.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? Your-your mother's coming? When?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Tomorrow.<br>
<i>Penny</i>When were you gonna tell me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, tomorrow?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why were you keeping this a secret?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I just, I thought-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I can <b title='interrupt'>interject</b> here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why wouldn't she approve of me? I'm adorable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are, it's just-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, it's a big menu. There's two pages just for desserts.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know. And those specials, they change every day.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you know what? It's <b title='weak and unconvincing'>lame</b> when I say it, it's just ridiculous when you <b title='exaggerate'>pile on</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what did she say when you told her we were going out?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um-<br>
<i>Penny</i>You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om">Wiki</a>]'>Om</b>.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Beverley</i>It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No trouble at all.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I drove, Mother. I'm driving now.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yes, dear. Mommy's proud. I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric <b title='dipole - a pair of electric charges or magnetic poles ↗monopole'>dipoles</b> in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate">Wiki</a>]'>Bose condensate</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>August 16th. Right after her <b title='the passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that connects the forearm to the middle compartment of the deep plane of the palm. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel">Wiki</a>]'>carpal tunnel</b> surgery.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You did.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>I don't really like flowers.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Neither do I, but it's the social convention.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>It is, isn't it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I heard that.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's what we think caused your <b title='too much interest in and admiration for your own physical appearance and/or your own abilities'>narcissistic</b> personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is <b title='baffle - cause sb to be completely unable to understand or explain sth'>baffling</b>.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yes, but we are on the subject, so I'm obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine, Mom. How are you?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Mmm, <b title='the cessation of a woman&#039;s reproductive ability [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause">Wiki</a>]'>menopausal</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Now I'm less fine.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>She's a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You must be very happy.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Why? I'm not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not the time, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>It's all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard's not <b title='withhold - refuse to give'>withholding</b> information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral <b title='tic - a sudden movement of a muscle in your face, that you cannot control'>tics</b> that accompanied your learning to <b title='give yourself or another person sexual pleasure by touching or rubbing the sexual organs'>masturbate</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Isn't she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.

<i>Beverley</i>So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally <b title='summon (up) - try very hard to have enough courage, energy, or strength'>summoned</b> the courage to express your <b title='sth that is latent exists but is not obvious and has not developed yet ↗dormant, overt, covert'>latent</b> homosexual feelings toward one another?<br>
<i>Howard</i>What? No.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>I see.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, really. I have a girlfriend now.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>And where is she this evening?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>I see. Her grandmother died.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know what you're talking about.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right. He "has" a "girlfriend."

<i>Beverley</i>Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this <b title="a hypothetical object whose phenomenal existence depends upon a subject's mind">construct</b>, the more you're hurting your partner.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Raj who has whispered to him) Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Arriving) Hi. Sorry I'm late.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, glad you're here, uh, sit down, I'll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally <b title='accept an unpleasant or sad situation and no longer feel upset or angry about it'>come to terms with</b> his little <b title='a player who hits the ball very hard in baseball'>slugger</b> growing breasts?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm gonna say no.<br>
<i>Howard</i>If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Classic <b title="In psychology, compensation is a strategy whereby one covers up, consciously or unconsciously, weaknesses, frustrations, desires, or feelings of inadequacy or incompetence in one life area through the gratification or (drive towards) excellence in another area. (Howard tries to prove he's not gay by complimenting Penny's breasts)">overcompensation</b>. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I'm divorcing yours.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yes. He was cheating on me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No!<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it sounded like a compliment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When did this happen?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Mmm, well, let's see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>September 22nd.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, yes, that's right. The weekend after Leonard's dog died.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mitzy's dead?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't believe this. Why am I the last to know?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who's getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one <b title='make a fuss - become angry or excited about sth and complain'>making a fuss</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, I'm way out of line!<br>
<i>Beverley</i>So, Penny, what's new in your life?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nothing. Not a damn thing.
<s>Penny's car.</s>
<i>Beverley</i>Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, it's not a problem.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you do not.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Your "check engine" light is on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Well, initially I felt something <b title='similiar to'>akin to</b> grief and perhaps anger, but that's the natural reaction of the <b title='a complex set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, right under the cerebrum. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system">Wiki</a>]'>limbic system</b> to being betrayed by a <b title='very bad or unpleasant =repulsive ↗awesome, fearsome, troublesome'>loathsome</b> son of a bitch.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure, sure.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Thankfully, my shock was somewhat <b title='mitigate =alleviate'>mitigated</b> by the fact that I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Eight years?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, that's nothing. I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='used as an expression of surprise or slight fear'>Yikes</b>. (Beverley chuckles) What's so funny?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>That's exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what? I <b title='would very much like'>could use</b> a drink. Do you wanna stop for a drink?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, I don't drink.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I do, I'll teach you.
<s>Leonard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I made tea.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't want tea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't make tea for you. This is my tea.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then why are you telling me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a conversation starter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's a lousy conversation starter.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, is it? We're <b title='converse - have a conversation with sb'>conversing</b>. Checkmate.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you want, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What I want is to be <b title='↗departure'>departing</b> the Starship Enterprise in a one-man <b title='small space vehicles in the fictional universe of Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttlecraft_(Star_Trek)">Wiki</a>]'>shuttlecraft</b> headed to the <b title='↗planet, asteroid'>planetoid</b> I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I want that too. Why are you here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To comfort you, of course. (Sits down on his bed) No, that's not going to work at all, I'll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you're experiencing is a classic <b title='Analytical psychology, or Jungian psychology, is a school of psychology that originated from the ideas of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology">Wiki</a>]'>Jungian</b> crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, that's very comforting.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not the comforting part.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltschmerz">Wiki</a>]'>Weltschmerz</b>. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right, I do feel better.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're my surrogate family?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either. Good night.
<s>A bar.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, now, this time try drinking it all at once.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yikes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I've been responsible for my own <b title='light-headed feeling'>buzz</b> since 2003. (To the bartender) Another round for me and my <b title='a female friend'>homegirl</b>.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>I feel a spreading warmth through my <b title='the parts of the human body furthest from the heart, for example, the fingers, toes and nose ↗torso, tousle'>extremities</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>As long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, that is fascinating. I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my <b title='inhibition - feeling of shyness or embarrassment that stops you doing or saying what you really want'>inhibitions</b>. For example, I'm seriously considering asking that <b title='a boy or man who removes dirty dishes from the tables in a restaurant'>busboy</b> to <b title='rape, violate'>ravish</b> me in the <b title='alley'>alleyway</b> while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Bev, guess what?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sleeping with your son.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Really? Which one?<br>
<i>Penny</i>The one from whom I live across the hall from.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Well, that's convenient. How'd his penis turn out?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Beverly, I-I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Oh, <b title='used to show that you understand why sb has done or said sth'>fair enough</b>. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy's penis?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Actually, I've only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not wanna tell you we were dating.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Really? Well, that means he's either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn't care enough about his mother to tell her he's in <b title='one relationship'>one</b>. Either way, <b title='Penny or Bev)'>one of us</b> should be insulted.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, let's go find out who.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>You go get a taxi. I'm gonna slip my business card into that busboy's back pocket, <b title='cup - hold sth as if in cup'>cupping</b> his firm, right buttock as I do so.

<i>Penny</i>Yeah, not bad, not bad.<br>

<i>Beverley</i>Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at <b title='an American fast-food restaurant chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Taco">Wiki</a>]'>Del Taco</b>? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thank you.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>You're welcome. Is it because she's uneducated, trapped in a <b title='menial work is boring, needs no skill, and is not important'>menial</b> service position?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What the hell happened to lovely and charming?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How come you didn't tell me that you and father were getting a divorce? How come you didn't tell me you had surgery? How come you didn't tell me my dog died?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I do.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>(Gives him an awkward hug) <b title='↗there, there - used to comfort a small child'>There</b>. It's late. Now, go to bed. (He goes to bed, looking back suspiciously) I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='It specializes in American-style Mexican cuisine (hot, spicy) as well as American foods'>That's the Del Taco</b>.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>You're very welcome.<br>

<i>Penny</i>I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behavior?<br>
<i>Beverley</i>I think it's best that you not know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Agreed.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Agreed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell, agreed.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thank you, Beverly.<br>
<i>Beverley</i>You're welcome. She doesn't have much in the way of career prospects, don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.<br>
