<i>Penny</i>Hey, do me a favor and take table seven.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard <b title='young man, esp one who is thought to be very active sexually and is regarded as a good sexual partner'>stud</b> of a fiancé who's prone to <b title='canker sore - a small sore inside the mouth, mouth ulcer'>canker sores</b> and <b title='inflammation of the conjunctiva (the outermost layer of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis">Wiki</a>]'>pinkeye</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless <b title='an insulting word for sb who is poor and works on a farm ↗Oklahoma'>Okie</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I know. But if she orders something low-fat I'll totally give her the full-fat version.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, that's my water.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My water. You're drinking it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. It's my water.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that's it then. I'm dead.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='said when sth bad starts happening again'>Here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every <b title='sth that causes disease'>pathogen</b> that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have <b title='defile - make sth less pure and good ↗deplore, denounce, degenerate, deteriorate'>defiled</b> one, but I won't have you talking <b title='offensive speech about sb'>smack</b> about the other.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You guys ready to order?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup_of_ipecac">Wiki</a>]'>syrup of ipecac</b>, to induce vomiting, and a mint.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He drank from Leonard's glass.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He drank from Leonard's glass. Words they'll be carving into my tombstone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's actually my napkin.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, this is a nightmare!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. <b title='used to clear a passage through a crowded area'>Gangway</b>! Dead man walking!
<s>The same.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a <b title='a carbonated, sweetened beverage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_beer">Wiki</a>]'>root beer</b> for Priya.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Is it diet?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's what you ordered.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah. We're thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He hasn't told her yet. He's waiting for the right time.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was thinking of weaving it into her <b title='a speech, usu at a funeral, in which a person who has just died is praised ↗tribute'>eulogy</b>.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Howard, you've got to tell your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of <b title='made when all the cream (also called milkfat) is removed from whole milk. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skimmed_milk">Wiki</a>]'>skim milk</b> here?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Uh, that's different. First of all, we're not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, <b title='having an upper-class way of behaving, snobbish'>la-di-da</b> approach to their sons.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I <b title='gargle - wash mouth ↗mouthwash'>gargled</b> with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You all right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fire demon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon's turning up the heat.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Troll master.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Water <b title='minor goddess living in rivers, trees, hills, etc'>nymph</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry. Walking tree.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Last one.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm taking a stroll and I'm <b title='sport wood - get an erection'>sporting wood</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Reading a text) Okay, <b title='Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin&#039;&#039;s completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off," before responding to Duke with the words, "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Wiki</a>]'>the Eagle has landed</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, that sounds lovely.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Have you met Bernadette's parents?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You mean <b title='the Hitlers'>Adolf and Eva</b>? Not yet. One <b title='a way of marching by soldiers'>goosestep</b> at a time.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, that's my water.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear Lord!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's not your water.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where's the mouthwash?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Holding it) Where indeed.
<s>Howard's house.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Ma, I'm home! Where are you?<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>I'm in the toilet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, how'd it go?<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>Too soon to say. I'm not done yet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>Oh! I had a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastrami">Wiki</a>]'>pastrami</b> sandwich. She had eggplant <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagne">Wiki</a>]'>lasagna</b>. Like that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>Oh, sure. Did you know she's going to school to become a microbiologist?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, she never mentioned it.<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>I bet she did and you didn't listen.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, that's probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She's great, huh?<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>I hope it's good news, because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy <b title='bear down - press on'>bearing down</b>? Ma? (Crashing sound from in bathroom) Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down! (Runs at door. It doesn't break down. Falls over.) Son of a bitch! Ma, help!
<s>The laundry room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Haven't seen you in a while. How's it going?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the <b title='≠mild ↗vicious, vigorous, virus'>virulent</b> organisms trooping through my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvillus">Wiki</a>]'>microvilli</b> into my circulatory system, <b title='ok, okey-dokey'>hunky-dory</b>. (Penny laughs) Did I say something amusing?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, your <b title='happiness, fun and laughter'>mirth</b> is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?<br>
<i>Penny</i>My mirth. Classic.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your <b title='nonsense [<a href="[<a href="">Wiki</a>]">Wiki</a>]'>jibber-jabber</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Jibber-jabber? I don't jibber-jabber.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you doing at work these days?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space">Wiki</a>]'>de Sitter space</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Alright, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God! What happened?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, let's go!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don't think so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my <b title='the part of your body between your neck and diaphragm (area just above your stomach)'>thorax</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right, fine. I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would think he would know that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine, I'll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and <b title='bite the dust - die'>bit the dust</b> a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's <b title='a shelf above a fireplace =mantelpiece ↗cremate, incinerate'>mantel</b>.
<s>A hospital waiting room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You're a real hero, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I did what any son would do.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was filled with <b title='a hormone and a neurotransmitter [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine">Wiki</a>]'>adrenaline</b>. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, how is she?<br>
<i>Howard</i>They're running tests. I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's the difference?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks for clearing that up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Regardless, <b title='connected with the heart'>coronary</b> problems are <b title='very, extremely'>eminently</b> treatable. What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs <b title='fester - form pus (a think yellowish or greenish liquid that is produced in an infected wound)'>festering</b> in <b title='every part of a place'>every nook and cranny</b> of this hospital.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you're not helping.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Disagree.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Go sit over there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll sit over there, it looks cleaner.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is there a history of heart disease in your family?<br>
<i>Howard</i>My family is the history of heart disease. There's a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this (clutches chest).<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So it's probably genetic.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's not important.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Come on, Howard, I'm gonna be your wife. You can share anything with me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You'd think that. But no.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You told her we were gonna get married and she had a heart attack?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You can't take that personally.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How else is she supposed to take it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>What you've got to keep in mind is that, ever since my dad left, I've been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can't.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You mean sexual intercourse?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.<br>
<i>Priya</i>(Arriving) What happened?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard's mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernie, wait!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Raj) I'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.
<s>The same, later.</s>
<i>Priya</i>Nice of you to come for Howard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, he's my friend. It's what you do. (Laughs)<br>
<i>Priya</i>I'm sorry, did I miss something?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose. {<a href="212.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/tbbt/212.html">212</a>}<br>
<i>Priya</i>That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, <b title='used to say that you already know how bad sth is, esp because you have experienced it yourself'>tell me about it</b>.<br>
<i>Priya</i>You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in <b title='leotard - close-fitting one-piece garment worn by acrobats, dancers etc'>leotards</b> and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You mean when he was little.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Not as little as you'd want him to be.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, this stuff is horrible. You wanna see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Sure. We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm fine. (They leave) That's nice that they're getting along.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Raj</i>One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't care. I don't have anything to hide.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I do not. You are a mean little man.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernie, it's not you. She's just <b title='be set in your ways - have habits or opinions that you have had for a long time and that you do not want to change'>set in her ways</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's wrong with the bathroom here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae">Wiki</a>] ↗pneumonia'>Pneumococcus</b>, <b title='any of a group of bacteria that cause serious infections and illnesses'>streptococcus</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus">Wiki</a>]'>staphylococcus</b>, and other assorted <b title='coccus - A bacterium having a spherical or spheroidal shape. spheroid - a shape that is similar to a ball, but not perfectly round'>coccuses</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiance is grief-<b title='very badly affected by trouble, illness, unhappiness etc'>stricken</b> over putting her there. I'm not taking you home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. (A doctor comes out of a door) Hold the door.<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Mr. Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Is she okay?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>It wasn't a heart attack. She's awake, she's resting comfortably, we're still running a few tests.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can I see her?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Actually, she said, and I quote, she'd "like to see the little Catholic girl first."<br>
<i>Bernadette</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews">Persecution of Jews</a>]'>Me? Why me?</b><br>
<i>Howard</i>Jews have been asking that for centuries. There's no real good answer.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay, wish me luck.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't worry, you'll be fine. Let's just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.<br>
<i>Doctor</i>You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Why don't I write you a prescription for <b title='a drug that inhibits anxiety [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam">Wiki</a>]'>Xanax</b>.
<s>A bathroom. A man comes in.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Comes out without touching the door) Finally. (Accidentally goes into a room with a "CAUTION BIOHAZARD" sign) Oh, what fresh hell is this?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Covers his mouth with the collar) No, I haven't. It's all good.<br>
<s>A hallway.</s>
<i>Penny</i>You wanna talk about crazy mothers, Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, the poor thing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It makes him desperate to please women. That's why the foreplay goes on and on.<br>
<i>Priya</i>It does, doesn't it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's like he's trying to win a prize. A word of advice: don't <b title='go to sleep'>doze off</b>. You will never hear the end of it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(In the room) Help me! Come back! Penny!
<s>The waiting room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but...<br>
<i>Raj</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Every once in a while, before we go to bed, I put on a little show for her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you mean "a show"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Like, to music?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So you do a striptease?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wasn't <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_dance">Wiki</a>]'>swinging around a pole</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Good, good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There was one time I put body glitter on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, she wouldn't.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Your big problem is me telling her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You really are a mean little man.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, God, that's so true.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, what took you guys so long?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, we were just chatting.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's nice. What about?<br>
<i>Penny</i>We were just comparing notes about how you are in the <b title='bed'>sack</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's funny. (They walk away)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What if she wasn't kidding?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It doesn't matter. I'm the king of foreplay.<br>
[Bernadette comes out]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, how'd it go?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You're a <b title='penis / fool'>putz</b>! You know what that means?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. Do you?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And are you?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, because I'm engaged to a putz.<br>You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, based on the available evid-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Shut up! She said I'm a wonderful girl and that you're lucky to have me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>To the toilet! Is that okay with you?!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Is it just me or did she sound sexy when she's angry?
<s>The room. Sheldon's in bed, the other guys are in isolation suit.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mountain Elf.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He takes the elf from off the shelf.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hell Hounds.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hell Hounds, who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='extremely large'>Colossal</b> Serpent.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I got a colossal serpent right here. (Touches his genitals)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Must you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon's new Facebook photo.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.<br>
