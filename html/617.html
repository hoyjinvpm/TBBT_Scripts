<i>Raj</i>Can I have your attention, please? We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with. We gotta stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.<br>
<i>Girl</i>That was cool. What you said.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee?<br>
<i>Girl</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Later, losers!
<s>and now...</s>
<i>Raj</i>So, then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful, not only because it's a good school but because it totally looks like <b title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts'>Wiki</a>]">Hogwarts</b>. That's where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so, I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that's enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.<br>
<i>Girl</i>I have to go to the bathroom.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I <b title="want to">care to</b> admit. Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing. (She leaves) Hmm. This is going great. (To the shop assistant) Mmm, can I have a refill on my <b title="a flavored tea beverage made by brewing black tea with a mixture of aromatic Indian spices and herbs [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai'>Wiki</a>]">chai tea</b>? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. (The girl can be seen sneaking past window and leaving) I should've bought condoms.

<i>Sheldon</i>Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honor of <b title="also known as African-American History Month in America [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month'>Wiki</a>]">Black History Month</b>, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of <b title=" an American scientist, botanist, educator, and inventor [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Carver'>Wiki</a>]">George Washington Carver</b> could be considered wildly racist. (Makes an air quotes gesture) My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by <b title="the government or to some other authority in a position of power">The Man</b>. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag <b title="sb who is very interested in something and knows a lot about it">aficionado</b>, it's also for the flag <b title="beginner ↗rookie, layman, veteran">novice</b>, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbor, and flag <b title="sb who has never experienced a particular activity">virgin</b>, yeah, not a real virgin. She's had coitus many times. Sometimes within <b title="the range within which sound can be heard">earshot</b> of <b title="Sheldon">this flag enthusiast</b>. Once while he was trying to watch <b title="a 2004 American computer-animated comedy superhero film [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredibles'>Wiki</a>]">The Incredibles</b>. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I can't tell you how many times I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags and I just couldn't join in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It's something we work on in my acting class.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you're all <b title="hunch - sit or stand with your back and shoulders curved forward">hunched</b> like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Right. And which one do I want?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Let's try open.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it's to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, well, I'm from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Gosh, Penny, what'd you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.
<s>Outside Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>I'm telling you, something's wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't look under that rock. (Knocking) Raj, you okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You in there?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Off) Go away!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, buddy, open up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're worried about you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, just because I've stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Did something good happen?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. (Opens door. He is wearing a stained vest, his hair is <b title="dirty and messy">unkempt</b>, and he is drinking wine from a bottle.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nope, just, just, whoa.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It smells pretty <b title="having a strong or unpleasant smell">ripe</b> in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj, what's going on?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I was humiliated by yet another woman.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You didn't kill her and chop her up, that's not what we're smelling, right?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. I took her for coffee, and she <b title="also sneaked">snuck</b> out the bathroom window to get away from me.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, you poor baby.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must've been very motivated.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sorry. That's awful, but come on, you gotta <b title="shake off - free oneself of; get rid of">shake it off</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of <b title="a line of food products by Hormel [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormel'>Wiki</a>]">Dinty Moore</b> beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Lobsters overnight?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you're kidding. Let me see. Well, <b title="an interjection">I'll be</b>. Look, you can <b title="add">throw in</b> a couple steaks and have a <b title="a main course which combines seafood and meat [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_and_turf'>Wiki</a>]">surf and turf</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have <b title="cornstick [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_on_the_cob'>Wiki</a>]">corn on the cob</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Guys, we're trying to get him out of here, not you in.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Now what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>We could go to <b title="an American casual dining restaurant chain [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster'>Wiki</a>]">Red Lobster</b> and talk about it. We're all thinking it. I just had the <b title="behavior that is moral, good, or reasonable ↗courtesy">decency</b> to wait for him to leave.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>(On webcam) Hello, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello. How's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Fine. Just hold on. (To her monkeys) Mommy's on the phone! Sorry. We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatworm'>Wiki</a>]">flatworms</b>. Those guys were <b title="relaxed, calm, happy, content">mellow</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Subtle, but powerful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. I'm still learning to control it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I do that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job. I'm sure she'd like to hear it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. (Gets up)<br>
<i>Amy</i>I didn't mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hi. What's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...<br>
<i>Penny</i>You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. I didn't start yet, it's fine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. So, what do you need?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night (knock, knock, knock) Penny. And I just wanted to tell you (knock, knock, knock) Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw, sweetie, you just <b title="make sb's day - make sb very happy">made my day</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, my acting class is <b title="put on - perform, produce">putting on</b> a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I wanna do that?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>(On webcam; to monkeys) That's right. They're no good without the lighter.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title="used to express disappointment and annoyance">So much for</b> your advice on complimenting Penny.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Why? What happened?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She tried to <b title="rope into - persuade sb to help you in a job or join in an activity, esp when they do not want to">rope us into</b> going to her acting class to see a play. Don't worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, that's very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is <b title="do the same thing for sb that they have done for you">reciprocate</b> by going to see her play.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, so many crazy rules. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Amy</i>(To a money) That better be <b title="Tootsie is a chocolate candy. The manufacturer, Tootsie Roll Industries, is based in Chicago, Illinois. [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tootsie_Roll'>Wiki</a>]">Tootsie Rolls</b> you're throwing at me!
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny. Penny. Oh yeah, much better.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I'm obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I'll go to your <b title="stupid">dopey</b> play.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, I don't want you to go any more.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You should go 'cause you wanna go, not because you have to.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Do whatever you want.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. I don't want to, but at least that makes sense.
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, I haven't seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, brilliant. I've been itching to pull that trigger.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would it help if I gave him some <b title="pointer - tip">pointers</b>? I'm just <b title="fun - joke, kid">funning</b> ya.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Hi. I don't know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Uh, yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you <b title="↗ditch">blew off</b> happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Sorry. Can you just give him this?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't wanna celebrate.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why would I want her number? I don't want anything to do with this woman.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, come on, Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, you don't get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I-I'm a monk. I <b title="give up ↗announce, denounce">renounce</b> all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_butter'>Wiki</a>]">garlic butter</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Boy, I wanna tell you it's her loss, but you are not making it easy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're, you're a good friend for trying to help, but, I've made my choice.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right. Well, I'll see you around.<br>
<i>Raj</i>See you. No, wait, take her number. I don't want the temptation.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I must be strong so I don't stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
<s>Outside on the street.</s>
<i>Raj</i>(Running in his underwear) Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So, Amy, what's going on with your addiction study?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sadly, I'm no longer associated with that project.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why? What happened?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you're unprofessional.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry... that I asked.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, let's get this stupid play over with.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know why. The <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS'>Wiki</a>]">Nintendo DS</b>. And the <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable'>Wiki</a>]">PSP</b>. Now the <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy'>Wiki</a>]">Gameboy</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Aw, for Pete's sake. Can we go now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, is that all of it? (Sheldon pulls a <b title="Magic Cube [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube'>Wiki</a>]">Rubik's cube</b> from his pants.) Just <b title="put">set</b> it down.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire'>Wiki</a>]">A Streetcar Named Desire</b> is an American classic.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's about <b title="tram, trolley [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram'>Wiki</a>]">streetcars</b>? Oh, great. I won't need this. (Pulls out an <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch'>Wiki</a>] ↗doodle">Etch A Sketch</b>.)
<s>Outside Raj's apartment. The girl from the comic book store knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh, would you like to come in?<br>
<i>Girl</i>Oh, no, I can't stay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Girl</i>I just wanted to say, I'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool. So, uh, yeah. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It's okay. I can take anything. Unless it's something I did, or said, or am. 'Cause those are, like, my <b title="press/push sb's buttons - make sb angry by doing or saying sth that annoys them">buttons</b>.<br>
<i>Girl</i>No, it's not any of that. It's just, I kinda have a hard time around people I don't know.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?<br>
<i>Girl</i>I've been trying to force myself into situations that I'm not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don't even like comic books.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, me neither.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Then what were you doing there?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I lied. I love them. I only said that so you'd go out with me.<br>
<i>Girl</i>You don't wanna do that. I'm kind of <b title="severely under the influence of drugs or alcohol">broken</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's great. I'm broken, too.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Oh, no, you're not.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, I totally am. If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even talk to you right now. I'm a <b title="sb who doesn't have their life in order ↗mess">wreck</b>. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not <b title="quirk - a strange or annoying habit">quirks</b>, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Well, how do I know you're not just saying that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Okay. Text me. Bye.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You won't regret it. I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.
<s>The theatre.</s>
<i>Penny</i> (As Blanche DuBois) You love her very much, don't you?<br>
<i>Actor</i>(As Mitch) Yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You'll be lonely when she <b title="pass on/away - die">passes on</b>, won't you? I understand what that is.<br>
<i>Actor</i>To be lonely?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's pretty good, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?<br>
<i>Penny</i>...when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. <b title="believing sth that is not true">Deluded</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's remarkable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She really is.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Our Penny's a star.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can't remember no tomato on my hamburger?
