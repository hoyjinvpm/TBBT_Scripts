<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Who wants the last dumpling?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ooh, me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last <b title='a small amount or a piece of sth, esp food =scrap'>morsel</b> is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you all for this high honor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, honey, if we're gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It's okay if he wants to come.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. But next time, we get a <b title='baby-sitter'>sitter</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, I gotta go to work. I'll walk down with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Neither of them are close.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me. Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pica_(disorder)">Pica</a>], or 12 points'>compulsion to eat dirt</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I'm not driving him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, Penny, don't give up, you can get this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aren't you going with Sheldon?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking <b title='all the people who regularly use a shop, restaurant etc ↗patron'>clientele</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so...<br>
<i>Amy</i>I can't imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Not really, no.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All righty then. Guess I'll just get started.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.
<s>The apartment. Amy is staring into space.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Amy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You okay?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, sure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought you were reading.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I was. Now I'm thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I, I'm fine.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Should I go? I've been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, who told you that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, most recently my <b title='↗ob/gyn'>gynaecologist</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you stay as long as you'd like.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm glad to hear you say that, because I'm having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.
<s>Raj's car.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>What are you gonna get at the train store, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm not buying anything. They're having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of <b title='a scale commonly used for toy trains and model railroading [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_scale">Wiki</a>]'>O-gauge</b>, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Which side do you <b title='support ↗stand'>come down on</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I'm going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother's house.<br>
<i>Howard</i>First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions. Secondly, when we get married, they're all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why would I keep clothes at your mother's house?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, don't think of it that way. Once we move in, it'll be our house.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Is she moving out?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why would she move out? It's her house.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hang on. You seriously think I'm gonna live with your mother?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her <b title='"Little pig, little fatty, let me come in." "No, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin." "Then I&#039;ll huff, and I&#039;ll puff, and I&#039;ll blow your house down."[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Little_Pigs">Wiki</a>]'>chinny chin chin</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Raj, take me home.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Take me home now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Movie theatre.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Mmmmmm.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don't care what you people do.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>How was your shower?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, I'm up all night. I'm like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not really. Is that my yearbook?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you're really good at science. Maybe one day you'll come up with a cure for being a <b title='nerd'>dork</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.<br>
<i>Amy</i>If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Dear Amy, self-respect and a <b title="the thin piece of skin that covers the entrance to a girl's vagina">hymen</b> are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Entering) Well, you can add Jerry's Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never <b title='enter'>set foot in</b> again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Rough night, <b title='an American railroader [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Jones">Wiki</a>]'>Casey Jones</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't know the half of it. It was <b title='bill as - advertise/describe'>billed as</b> a lively <b title='an exchange of ideas or statements'>give-and-take</b> on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless <b title='rube - sb, usu from the country, who has no experience of other places and thinks in a simple way ↗redneck'>rubes</b> into buying H-O starter sets.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's in the bag?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't wanna talk about it. But it's not a spine, I'll tell you that.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah, sure. That'd be nice.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They're kind of the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brangelina">Wiki</a>]'>Brad and Angelina</b> of the <b title='the branch of zoology that deals with the study of primates'>primatology</b> department.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not my fault. You said there'd be other scientists there my age.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Doesn't matter. You're out, he's in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
<s>Outside Howard's house. Bernadette rings the bell.</s>
<i>Howard</i>I'll get it!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Could you get it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I said I'm getting it!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Fine, I'll get it!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I got it! Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hey. I don't wanna fight. I was just surprised when you <b title='spring on - tell sb sth or ask them to do sth when they do not expect it and are not ready for it'>sprung</b> the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't <b title='run by/past - tell sb sth so that they can give you their opinion'>run it by</b> you first.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I don't know who you're talking to, but in or out! We don't need bugs!<br>
<i>Howard</i>The bugs only come here because you're their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. You know, stay here for a weekend, see what it's like.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Your mom would be okay with that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Hey, if she's willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?<br>
<i>Howard</i>See? She's good with it.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!
<s>The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All this years, I've been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? For a wedding?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Perhaps you're right. My cheekbones and <b title='if sth beckons to you, it is very attractive and you feel you have to do sth to get it ↗beacon'>beckoning</b> <b title='the set of large wide curved bones at the base of your spine, to which your legs are joined'>pelvis</b> already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ready.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Better than James Bond, because he's tinier.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I got you this to give to me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally wear <b title='corsage - a decoration made of flowers that a woman wears on a dress or suit'>corsages</b> to a wedding. That's more of a prom thing.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Put the corsage on her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Amy, this is for you. (Put the corsage on her ample bosom)<br>
<i>Amy</i>When you're done <b title='cop a feel - touch sb in a sexual way when they do not want you to'>copping a feel</b>, that goes on my wrist.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All aboard! Woo-woo! It's official. I'm an H-O <b title='train + maniac ↗mania'>trainiac</b>.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, dinner went nice.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Only when it's fatty. Well, don't be jealous, babe. Someday you'll get to cut it for me.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Bernadette! I found the extra head for the <b title='an oral irrigator [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_irrigator">Wiki</a>]'>Waterpik</b> if you wanna use it!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm okay, Mrs Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>You sure? I just squirted half a <b title='meat from the chest of an animal, esp a cow'>brisket</b> outta my teeth!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Oh, I know what that means! <b title="an exclamation of admiration, approval, or enthusiasm, used esp by G.I.'s of World War II as a shout in appreciation of a pretty girl.">Hubba hubba</b>!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, God.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Relax, it'll be fine.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Let me know when you're done <b title='canoodle - hold and kiss sb in a romantic way ↗cuddle'>canoodling</b>! Mommy needs a foot rub!
<s>The wedding.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Would you like to dance?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, thank you. I'm really not much of a dancer.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Not exactly winning any trophies as a <b title='sb who is good at talking to others'>conversationalist</b>, either.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Why shouldn't they be? They have a <b title='extremely excited'>feverish</b> night of socially-approved <b title='copulate - have sex ↗coitus, sexual intercourse, consummate'>copulation</b> ahead of them. In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so-<br>
<i>Amy</i>Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a <b title='sb/sth that gives great pleasure'>delight</b> here. And you're not <b title="hold one's end of the bargain up - do one's part as agreed">holding up your end</b> of the evening.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who's playing with a model train right now, you don't hear me <b title='bitch - make unpleasant remarks'>bitching</b> about it. Leonard, a word of advice, <b title='annoyed or unhappy ↗bad/ill-tempered'>moody</b> self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not moody. I'm fun.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You have any evidence to support that statement?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, hey, I'm just as much fun as you are.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine, what do you suggest?<br>
<i>Amy</i>We just had a lovely meal, the band is <b title='doing very well; very enthusiastic'>on fire</b>, and you're sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing <b title='↗whore, tramp, slutty'>whorish</b> makeup. Why don't we head out on the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Once again, I, I'm really not much of a dancer.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't worry, I'll lead. (Shows her "moustache") [They do the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Dance#Birdie_Song">Wiki</a>]'>Birdie Song dance</b>]

<i>Bernadette</i>Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ready for bed?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother's been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight's not your night!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>You don't know that! I just sat down!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, take a <b title='stop/rest'>break</b>! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>She can come in and brush her teeth! I'm not embarrassed!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Problem solved.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, it's not. I'm not going in there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, come on, honey. She's just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can't see anything. I go in all the time.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Ha! The eagle has landed!<br>
<i>Howard</i>And we have <b title='a landing of a spacecraft in the sea/ocean'>splashdown</b>. Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.
<s>The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.</s>
<i>Amy</i>There we go, last floor.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I just can't figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just <b title='snap - break with a sudden sharp noise'>snapped</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='a participation dance [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokey_cokey">Wiki</a>]'>Hokey pokey</b> is a young man's game.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it's okay to have fun once in a while.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You're welcome.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a <b title='idea based on intuition or instinct and not on evidence'>hunch</b> that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, okay. Again, thank you.<br>
<i>Amy</i>And again, you're welcome.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wanna come in, have a cup of tea?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, thanks. I'm gonna <b title='move in a particular direction'>head</b> home.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, good night.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny's door)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ames, hi. How was the wedding?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come in, let's talk. Do you want a glass of wine?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this <b title='a difficult or embarrassing situation, predicament'>fix</b>. That and this <b title='damn'>dang</b> pelvis.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?<br>
<i>Amy</i>The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let's face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God, did he <b title='↗hit on'>make a move on</b> you?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, but it's only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack's heart.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been <b title='defile - violate the chastity'>defiled</b> by the same man, Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No. I'll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I'll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his <b title='a place that is exciting and full of beautiful and interesting things'>wonderland</b>. I mean, frankly, you've got a better <b title='chance'>shot</b> than he does. (Shows her "moustache", "I'll lead. ")

<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sounds like you had a great night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did. How was yours?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What exactly do you mean by that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse <b title='because of damage or loss of quality caused by use'>for wear</b>. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To send a message. She is not for you.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Not for you!

<i>Howard</i>Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Your mom and I made you breakfast.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, I guess. We're very different people, Howard, so communication's a little tricky.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Does he like the pancakes?!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He didn't try them yet!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Is there any butter?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It's butter-flavored syrup.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>So, what's the word?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He wants butter!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>It's butter-flavored syrup.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I just told him that!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't need any butter.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>If you want butter, I'll get you butter.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.
