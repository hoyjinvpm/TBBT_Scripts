<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That's how I learned.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't believe you've never seen <b title='Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark">Wiki</a>]'>Raiders of the Lost Ark</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And I can't believe you've never read <b title='Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman&#039;s Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia is a 2006 memoir by American author Elizabeth Gilbert. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat,_Pray,_Love">Wiki</a>]'>Eat, Pray, Love</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A <b title='a gathering point for UFO believers [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Rock">Wiki</a>]'>Giant Boulder</b>, I'll read it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I'm not reading it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller">Wiki</a>]'>Michael Jackson's Thriller video</b>, which I've never viewed <b title='as a whole'>in its entirety</b>, as I find zombies dancing in <b title='arranged but is intended to appear natural'>choreographed</b> synchronicity implausible. And also, it's really scary.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's no switch. Just listen and learn.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at <b title='Colonial Theater [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Theatre">Wiki</a>]'>the Colonial</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I'm watching it now. Why would I wanna see it again on Friday?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because the <b title='A release print is a copy of a film that is provided to a movie theater for exhibition'>print</b> they're showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What, 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did Leonard? I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm. (She indicates it was) Oh, good. I'm <b title='26 guesses, 8 correct'>eight for twenty six</b> this month.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I think I'll <b title='refuse to accept an offer etc'>pass</b>. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh-huh. I'm guessing <b title='↗premature ejaculation'>21 seconds had something to do with that</b>, too.
<s>The Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I point out to you all that the <b title='the showing of a film or television program'>screening</b> is first come, first served?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Relax, it's five o'clock. The movie doesn't start till midnight.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it's already five o'clock. Let's go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See? Howard's on my side.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Actually, I'm not. I'm using sarcasm to mock you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to show you are annoyed'>Drat</b>. Now I'm 8 for 27.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight <b title='the first public performance of a movie or play ↗debut'>premiere</b> of Star Trek: Nemesis?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a <b title='a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid warrior species in the science fiction franchise Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon">Wiki</a>]'>Klingon</b> when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn't wake up to <b title="say that you believe sb is good ">vouch for</b> him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But how were our seats?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excellent.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='have no more to say about sth, esp because you think you have proved your point'>I rest my case</b>. Amy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I'll gain more acceptance by <b title='decided or arranged without any reason or plan'>arbitrarily</b> <b title='side with - support one person or group in an argument against sb else'>siding with</b> your friends <b title='sometimes but not often, occasionally, (every) now and again/then'>from time to time</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='A shrewd person is able to understand and judge a situation quickly and to use this understanding to their own advantage. ↗cunning, sly, slippery'>Shrewd</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Leonard, you're right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in <b title='used at the end of a clause to give emphasis in negative statements, conditional clauses, and questions'>at all</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>See? It's working.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i><b title='The knock-knock joke is a type of joke. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock-knock_joke">Wiki</a>]'>Knock-knock</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Who's there?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Olive.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Olive you, too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Guys, that's really starting to get old.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Knock-knock.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who's there?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I have a girlfriend and you don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='very funny, hilarious'>Hysterical</b>!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished. I have a girlfriend and you don't who?<br>
<i>Howard</i>So. Are you sure you don't wanna come with us to <b title='Raiders of the Lost Ark'>Raiders</b>?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that <b title='a very small bottle used for medicine, perfume etc'>vial</b> of flesh-eating bacteria into the <b title='small monkey, often used in biological experiments [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque">Wiki</a>]'>Rhesus monkey</b> lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls' night tonight.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Girls' night? What does that <b title='involve, cause ↗incur'>entail</b>?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm a girl.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I'll ask Penny.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No need. Penny and I are very close.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes. In fact, our <b title='monthly flow of blood, menstruation, period'>menses</b> are synchronized. (Goes to the bar) Penny. Bernadette tells me you're planning a girls' night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm a girl.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Um, it was, it was just gonna be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What's the dress <b title='a set of rules, laws, or principles that tell people how to behave ↗protocol'>code</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, just wear something comfortable.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right. I'll have to go shopping.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Knock-knock.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who's there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hugh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hugh who?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hugh people need to listen to me. It's time to get in line for the movie. And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.
<s>The movie theatre. The line is incredibly long.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Under normal circumstances I'd say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such <b title='vehement - showing very strong feelings or opinions'>vehemence</b> and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you <b title='=thus'>thusly</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I informed you thusly.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Eight for 28.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is where we could've been if we hadn't stopped for dinner. This is where we could've been if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And here's where we are. The <b title='runt - the smallest and least developed baby animal of a group born at the same time'>runts</b> in a large <b title=' all the young born to an animal at one time'>litter</b>, unlikely to ever reach the <b title='a nourishing drink or food makes you healthy and strong'>nourishing</b> <b title='teat - nipple'>teats</b> of Indiana Jones.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, shut up.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title=' thing that is regrettable; a pity'>Shame</b>. 'Cause I have a real <b title='a clever humorous remark that might also be insulting'>zinger</b> about my tilted uterus.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Penny, your nails look great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thanks. I found this place in <b title='a city [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Alhambra</b>. It's in a woman's basement. I think it's a <b title='sth that serves to hide an illegal or a secret activity'>front</b> for <b title='the trade in humans [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking">Wiki</a>]'>human trafficking</b>, but they do a really good job.<br>
<i>Amy</i>A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized <b title='↗pedicure'>manicure</b> <b title='tool or instrument'>implements</b>. Well don't tell me that's not girl talk.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Or we could just stay here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Gee, I don't know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I've got enough trouble seeing over the <b title='the part of a car in front of the driver that has instruments and controls in it ↗windshield, windscreen, steering wheel'>dashboard</b> as it is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's okay. You can just sleep here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, good, a <b title='sleepover, pajama party [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepover">Wiki</a>]'>slumber party</b>! We'll do <b title='makeover - the process of improving the appearance of a person or a place'>makeovers</b>, initiate <b title='a telephone practical joke [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank_call">Wiki</a>]'>phony phone calls</b>, and have <b title='showing great energy and courage'>spirited</b> pillow fights in our <b title='having a lot of frills. frill - a narrow piece of cloth that has many small folds in it, and that is attached to sth as a decoration ↗ruffle, lace'>frilly</b> <b title='nightie - nightdress, nightgown'>nighties</b>!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gosh, Amy. I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, that's disappointing. I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, you never were?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not even when you were a kid?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn't make it through the night, but up till then, it was <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> fun.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party. (Amy hits her with a pillow) Oh!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Pillow fight!
<s>The movie line.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a <b title='The Gatorade Company, Inc. is a manufacturer of sports-themed beverage and food products [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade">Wiki</a>]'>Gatorade</b> every time. A <b title='≠virtuous circle'>vicious circle</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's a <b title='an apparatus which consists of a collecting bag fastened around the leg and tubing that attaches to a condom catheter. It allows an individual to "conveniently" urinate without having to make use of a restroom. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_buddy">Wiki</a>]'>stadium pal</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your <b title='the thick back part of your leg between your knee and your ankle ↗shin, thigh'>calf</b> warm.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre and the length of this line, we might not get seats.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What did he say?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We might not get seats?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's fine, it's fine. Go back to sleep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You're peeing, aren't you?<br>
<i>Wil Wheaton</i>Hey, look who's here! Hey, buddies!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the <b title='a fictional character from Star Wars [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks">Wiki</a>]'>Jar Jar Binks</b> of the Star Trek universe.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Mee-sa think that very funny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. <b title='No cutting in line. Go to the back of the line and wait your turn.'>No cuts, no buts, no coconuts</b>.<br>
<i>Theatre Staff</i>Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Theatre Staff</i>I'm a big fan.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of what? Poorly <b title='execute - make/produce'>executed</b> beards?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.<br>
<i>Theatre Staff</i>No problem. Come on, I'll <b title='put a sb in a favorable position'>hook</b> you up.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Calm down, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I will not calm down.

<i>Bernadette</i>No, just the one. But it's really long.<br>

<i>Amy</i>My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.

<i>Leonard</i>Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's only gonna upset you.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>Um.<br>

<i>Amy</i>And Absolon hath kist hir nether yayeh, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte."<br>
<i>Penny</i>What the hell was that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miller%27s_Tale">Wiki</a>]'>Miller's Tale</b> by <b title='1343 – 25 October 1400 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Wiki</a>]'>Chaucer</b> is the dirtiest story I know. It would've been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yayeh.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You might not like it as much if you knew what <b title="a women's anus">nether yayeh</b> meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Truth.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, that's an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an <b title='excessive'>inordinate</b> amount of time in each other's company.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Dare.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't believe the rules allow for an <b title='formulated, enacted'>ex post facto</b> option change.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends. I mean, Leonard's a great guy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You can only ask one question.<br>
<i>Amy & Bernadette</i>(In unison) That one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what, I don't wanna play anymore.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, I'm not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.

<i>Sheldon</i>You whistled?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can't see it, no one else can see it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, this is crazy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Listen to me. You are over-tired. You're not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it's Lee, but I prefer Trouble.<br>
<i>Wil Wheaton</i>Oh, look who they let in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving. Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>She's been in there a long time.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Ooh, like what?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I'm sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?<br>
