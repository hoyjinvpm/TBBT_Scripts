<i>Howard</i>Gagh!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Problem?<br>
<i>Howard</i>This is the worst <b title='a shoemaker / a traditional baked dish [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobbler_(food)">Wiki</a>]'>cobbler</b> I've ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey guys, guess who I found at <b title=' the airport identifier code for Los Angeles International Airport'>LAX</b>. My baby sister Priya.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don't give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say, your sister Priya.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit, have you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I change?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The hope's been that you'd eventually <b title='↗cave/give in'>bend to</b> public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?<br>
<i>Priya</i>I have a one day <b title='a short stop in a long trip =stopver'>layover</b> on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can you believe it? Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it's actually extremely <b title='reasonable and likely to be true'>plausible</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a>]'>And your poll numbers just keep dropping</b>.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I want to <b title='talk to sb you have not seen for some time and find out what they have been doing'>catch up</b> with all of you, but first I really must visit the <b title='toilet'>loo</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm going too, I'll show you where it is.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Alright, this goes without saying, but I'm just gonna say it anyway. Hands off my sister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I've got a girlfriend now.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh please. My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let's just agree they're both hot.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, that's my sister you're talking about.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, forget who's hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would <b title='start talking to sb to show them that you are sexually attracted to them'>hit on</b> her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Did you <b title='little finger'>pinky</b> swear?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay then.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Cobbler. I'm still laughing.
<s>A corridor.</s>
<i>Priya</i>It's really nice to see you again Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. It's good to see you too. Here you go.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Thanks. (Grabs him and kisses him.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. (Looks around) Okay. (They kiss again)
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, you got any special plans with your sister?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, not really, just hang out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Train day?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The fun starts with <b title='late morning meal eaten instead of breakfast and lunch'>brunch</b> at Carney's in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_City,_Los_Angeles">Wiki</a>]'>Studio City</b>, a hot dog <b title='stall ↗newsstand, vendor'>stand</b> in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, <b title='a transport museum [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_Town_Museum">Wiki</a>]'>Travel Town</b>, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other <b title='all the trains, carriages etc that are used on a railway'>rolling stock</b> from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we're off to the <b title='the attractive and exciting quality of being connected with wealth and success glitz = glamor'>glitz and glamor</b> of Hollywood for dinner at, that's right, the Hollywood Carney's, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't think we're gonna do that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well then apparently, you hate fun.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm, Priya's not back yet? Well, I guess that's not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh, my plans with Priya.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He rejected train day.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='abundantly clear - very clear'>Abundantly</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I guess he just hates fun.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's what I said.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Okay, so, what's new with you guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I have a girlfriend now.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Hey, good for you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I <b title='accidentally ↗inevitablely'>inadvertently</b> <b title='force a liquid out in a thin fast stream ↗spray'>squirt</b> any <b title='pheromone - a chemical substance which an animal releases that influences the behavior of another creature of the same type, for example by attracting it sexually'>pheromones</b> in your direction. (To Raj) Happy? (Raj nods).<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you're here.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I don't know, I just have the one day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you like trains?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Not particularly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You <b title='used to say that the effect of an action or situation is the same as if it was another one'>might as well</b> just wait at the airport for your flight.
<s>The apartment. Sheldon is on his laptop.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You are in a forest. There is <b title='wet sand that is dangerous because you sink down into it if you try to walk on it [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksand">Wiki</a>]'>quicksand</b> to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It's locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's pretty cool.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip, imagination.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You've really got to get out more.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go north. You can't go that way. Go west. A <b title='a supernatural being [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll">Wiki</a>]'>troll</b> blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. (There is a knock on the door.) You don't have the sword. Good <b title='used to express surprise =gosh'>golly</b>, it's as if it's actually happening to me.<br>
<i>Priya</i>(At door) Raj finally went to bed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, (Closes the door behind him and kisses her in the hallway) Sheldon's still up.<br>
<i>Priya</i>You said he goes to bed at nine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hit troll with ax. Hit troll with ax. Hit troll with ax. Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>, this is one tough troll.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Can't you get rid of him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If the past is any indication, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I'm trapped in quicksand, the ax is dragging me down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Drop ax.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Drop ax. Brilliant.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give me a minute. (Enters the apartment) Sheldon,<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well then, bed, mister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Five more minutes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? You're gonna risk getting sleepy in the middle of your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Thermodynamic_fluctuations_and_statistical_physics">Wiki</a>]'>thermodynamic fluctuations</b> seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Everyone will see my oddly shaped <b title='the piece of flesh that hangs down at the back of your mouth'>uvula</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You don't want that, do you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. But <b title='used when you wish a situation was different, and you feel sad or disappointed'>it's a shame</b> our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's unacceptable. We're supposed to be given written notice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, it doesn't matter, we'll be at work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there's no water for an <b title='a macromolecular biological catalyst'>enzyme</b> soak.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='bifurcation - the splitting of a main body into two parts. furcate - divided into branches, forked'>Bifurcated</b> uvula, Sheldon!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Priya) We're gonna have to be very quiet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the ax around (Priya jumps over the couch and hides) and use the handle to reach it. Let's see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I'm lost. Well, I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to <b title='map out - plan carefully'>map it out</b>. Come on, I'll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times? (Priya sneaks into Leonard's room)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right, you're lost, good luck. (Goes into his room)
<s>Leonard's bedroom. Morning.</s>
<i>Priya</i>Oh! Leonard, wake up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Huh! Sorry!<br>
<i>Priya</i>For what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl, it's just, it's my go to response.<br>
<i>Priya</i>It's six o' clock, I have to get back to Raj's before he wakes up and realises I'm gone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Mmm. Me too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Where are you going with this, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I'm just saying, I don't have any real <b title="tie - thing that limits sb's freedom of action">ties</b> here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Leonard, didn't we have this conversation five years ago.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you're older, I'm older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn't mean I want to have a serious relationship.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It doesn't?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They'd <b title='be very worried, upset, or angry / eat a cow'>have a cow</b>. Which is<b title='Cattle are considered sacred in world religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and others. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_in_religion">Wiki</a>]'> a much bigger deal in India</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that's not the right kind of Indian but it is something.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Aha, you're funny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I heard a woman laughing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Air freshener.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, <b title="an area of red spots on sb's skin, caused by an illness or a reaction to sth">rash</b>, that's a bad rash.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My sympathies. I am no stranger to the <b title='dark red'>crimson</b> <b title='sth that causes a lot of harm or suffering'>scourge</b> that is <b title='a skin condition in which the skin becomes red, swollen and sore'>dermatitis</b>. Can I interest you in a <b title='relating to a subject that is of particular interest at the present time'>topical</b> <b title='a medicine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid">Wiki</a>]'>steroid</b> from my lotion and <b title='a thick soft substance used on your skin =ointment'>unguent</b> collection?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, yeah, yeah, that-that sounds great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very well, I'm sure I can find something that will help you <b title='get rid of'>ditch</b> that itch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, he's in the bathroom, let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you prefer ointment or cream?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, cream.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>With or without a <b title='making you unable to feel anything'>numbing</b> <b title='force or substance that produces an effect or change'>agent</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Without.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. With.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Prescription or non-prescription strength.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Use your best judgement.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I think I have a nice 2009 <b title='[<a href="https://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?_adv_prop=image&fr=moz35&va=AnaMantle+HC">Images</a>]'>AnaMantle HC</b>. It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed <b title='painful swollen veins at or near the anus, piles [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid">Wiki</a>]'>haemorrhoids</b>, but it also goes nicely with <b title='mucosal - of or relating to the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mucous_membrane">mucous membranes</a>'>nonmucosal</b> body parts.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sounds great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent choice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Whispering) Right, right, alright. (They creep almost to the apartment door.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Priya?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Good morning, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think, I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='Having'>Making</b> pretty good time, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is that really what you wanna talk about, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you want to talk about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There it is. What if someone asks?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No-one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Priya and I are both adults. We didn't betray Raj.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>April 12th, 2005, <b title='a restaurant chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Big_Boy">Wiki</a>]'>Bob's Big Boy</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluca_Lake,_Los_Angeles">Wiki</a>]'>Toluca Lake</b>. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to <b title='try to persuade a woman to love him and marry =court'>woo</b> her. I had a <b title='a type of hamburger consisting of a hamburger patty and Cheddar or Swiss cheese between two slices of bread [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_melt">Wiki</a>]'>patty melt</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And Raj.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Alright, and Raj.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay fine, I'm, I'm a horrible human being, I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a <b title='sb who changes from one side, party, etc to another ↗traitor, defect, treason'>turncoat</b> <b title='a fictional race that appear in the Star Wars universe. They are hunter-gatherers resembling teddy-bears that inhabit the forest moon of Endor. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewok">Wiki</a>]'>Ewok</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My point is, Priya's gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean, you want me to keep a secret.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know I can't keep a secret.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth">Wiki</a>]'>Alfred</b>, you'd keep that secret. Right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why do you <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> be Batman?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because, Batman has the secret.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well Alfred has secrets too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I've now just told to Batman. See, I can't keep a secret.
<s>Leonard's lab.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ta-da!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ta-da. It's short for da-da-da-da!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Kind of busy here, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know, that's why I shortened it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you want.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I came to go over your <b title='excuse'>alibi</b> for last night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What alibi?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You've asked me to lie, <b title='because of/for you'>on your behalf</b>, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with <b title='done without preparation or planning'>impromptu</b> dishonesty, so, I've provided you with an iron <b title='covered'>clad</b> alibi. You couldn't have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm so sure I'm gonna regret this, but, who was I with?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The fun loving, and morally <b title='having or involving an attitude to sexual relationships that people consider to be immoral'>loose</b>, Miss Maggie McGeary.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, God.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You met her at Pasadena's most popular Irish <b title='a bar or place where people go to drink'>watering hole</b>, Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Reading a napkin Sheldon has handed him) Leonard, call me if you're interested in <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b>. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And if anyone were to actually call that number, they will hear, this.<br>
<i>Mechanical voice on Sheldon's phone</i><b title='another way to say "good morning," often associated with the Irish'>Top of the morning</b> to you. You've reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the <b title='(esp Scot) little'>wee</b> little beep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn't even a real person. And here is the <b title='sth that settles an argument, makes sb decide sth, or helps sb achieve sth'>clincher</b>. A <b title='a few hairs that hang or lie together'>lock</b> of Maggie's flaming <b title='reddish-brown'>auburn</b> hair.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where did you get that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>From an <b title='red great ape [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan">Wiki</a>]'>orangutan</b> in the primate lab.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>An orangutan?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, no-one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I don't need an alibi. Nobody's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. (Sheldon makes lip zipping movement.) Thank you. Now don't worry, everything is gonna be fine. (Sheldon writes "I doubt it" on Leonard's whiteboard.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister's never been attracted to him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on Raj, how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to in the future.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of <b title='an American science fiction drama television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprica_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Caprica</b> last night?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't see it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Didn't see it? What were you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, I was out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>On Caprica night?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really, you, and where, where did you go?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>To, uh, Lucky Baldwin's.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I've heard of that place, isn't that Pasadena's <b title='best liked'>favorite</b> Irish watering hole?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a <b title='having sexual relations with many people'>promiscuous</b> redheaded barmaid?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>As a matter of fact, I- I- I can't- I can't- I can't do it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sure you can, you're doing fine, it's very believable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't listen to him, he's still <b title='feeling as though you might fall down or become unconscious, for example because you are drunk ↗hangover, dizzy, woozy'>lightheaded</b> from all the Irish whiskey and <b title=' hard boiled eggs that are cured in vinegar or brine. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_egg">Wiki</a>]'>pickled eggs</b> in his system.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What were you doing with Priya?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What? You slept with my sister?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How could you? We had a pact!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me, I think how could you she's my sister takes <b title='priority'>precedence</b> over a five year old pinky swear!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I- I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. And to her, I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I- I don't believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>How hard did she stomp?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Very hard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, I'm good.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, well, Raj, I just wanna say that I'd never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Mmm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a <b title='a type of toilet for men that is attached to the wall'>urinal</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude! I put that thing on my face!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I didn't see you giving back your Snoopy <b title='Snow cones are a variation of the shaved ice dessert [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_cone">Wiki</a>]'>snow cone</b> maker.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That was all a lie? This year's gifts are already wrapped!<br>
<i>Howard</i>And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard's food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You put moths in my food?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For science.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, uh, I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You used my toothbrush?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I, I, I think it's safe to say that we've all done some things we're not particularly proud of. But come on, we're friends. Friends overlook each other's minor <b title='lapse - small error'>lapses</b>. For the record, Howard, I'm sorry that I broke our pact.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you. I'm sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we're at it, you don't have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.<br>
<i>Raj</i>As long as we're apologizing, Sheldon, I'm, I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I'm sorry. But that behavior is <b title='considered by most people to be unacceptable or unreasonable'>beyond the pale</b> and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I got you a talking <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine">Wiki</a>]'>Thomas the Tank Engine</b> for Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>With real puffing smoke?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alright. But I'm watching you.

<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snow cone?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, sure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>These are pretty god, what flavor is this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Guess.<br>
