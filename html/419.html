<i>Policeman</i>Here. Breathe into this bag.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They stole everything, Leonard, everything.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Are you the roommate?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, my God, what did they get?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What didn't they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my <b title='brutal'>vicious</b> gladiator armor, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You called the police because someone hacked your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">Wiki</a>]'>World of Warcraft</b> account?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Into the bag.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They took my battle ostrich.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, not Glenn?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Good luck, fellas.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, officer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait a minute! You're not going to do anything?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Mr. Cooper, there's nothing-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Doctor Cooper.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Seriously?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not the kind with access to drugs.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Fine. Dr. Cooper. I'm sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's from <b title='a 2009 American epic science fiction film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%282009_film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Avatar</b>, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. <b title='used for expressing surprise'>Goodness gracious</b>, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a <b title='sb who behaves badly, but in a harmless way, or who is dishonest and immoral ↗rouge'>rogue</b> ex-cop?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, one who was <b title='drum off - force sb to leave an organization as a punishment for doing sth wrong'>drummed off</b> the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, officer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's all gone. All gone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm really sorry, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This act of <b title='angry or threatening behavior, attack'>aggression</b> must be met with swift and cruel <b title='violence'>ferocity</b>. It is time to <b title='sound an alarm, warn'>cry havoc</b>, and <b title='↗unleash'>let slip</b> <b title='a phrase from Act 3, Scene 1, line 273 of William Shakespeare&#039;s Julius Caesar: "Cry "Havoc!", and let slip the dogs of war".

<i>Leonard</i>I'm on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See if Raj is done with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates">Wiki</a>] ↗yoga'>Pilates</b>.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn't leave a digital fingerprint.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! There isn't enough <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamomile">Wiki</a>] ↗chrysanthemum'>camomile</b> tea in the world to <b title='suppress'>quell</b> the rage in my heart.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Can we trust him?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jewelled ostrich <b title='a set of leather bands put around a horse&#039;s head and used to control its movements ↗rein'>bridle</b>!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. Glenn's was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Penny. We're kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That game? Excuse me, Penny, but <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle_Jump">Wiki</a>]'>Doodle Jump</b> is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing- all right, technically it's a game.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, <b title='=anyway'>anyways</b>, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Stale pastry is hollow <b title='help and sympathy '>succor</b> to a man who is <b title='completely lacking'>bereft</b> of ostrich.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just say thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I thought I just did.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. See you later.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh! Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that's useful in a make-believe place.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I don't know what that means.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well, sadly, I do.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard <b title='inline skating [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_skating">Wiki</a>] ↗figure skating'>rollerblading</b> at the beach? Can you believe that?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I feel like I'm supposed to say that bitch, but I don't have enough information.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach <b title='in/at the beginning'>in the first place</b>. And he was so <b title='having a strong unreasonable fear or hatred of sth'>phobic</b> about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I think you're on.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh. That bitch!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Want some <b title='Liqueurs are alcoholic beverages that are bottled with added sugar and have added flavors that are usually derived from fruits, herbs, or nuts. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_liqueurs#Coffee_liqueurs">Wiki</a>]'>coffee liqueur</b> on your ice cream?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Ah, here's the alcohol and drug <b title='an influence when a peer group, or individual encourages another person to change their values, or behaviors to suit other peoples convenience. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">Wiki</a>]'>peer pressure</b> Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never gonna happen. Yes, please.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm drunk.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm never speaking to Priya again.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, don't do that. No reason to be mean to her.<br>
<i>Amy</i>This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_University">Wiki</a>]'>Kyoto University</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, but I can name all <b title='Keeping Up with the Kardashians is an American reality television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_Up_with_the_Kardashians">Wiki</a>]'>the Kardashians</b>.<br>

Bernadette's urge to <b title='avoid'>shun</b>, <b title='look at sb in an angry way ↗glare, glower'>scowl</b> or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't have an urge to fling my waste.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Believe me, it's there, we all have it. Hit me with some more <b title='alcoholic drink ↗liquor, spirits'>booze</b>, and I'll show you.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>All right, here we are, this is the <b title='↗inn, pub, bar'>tavern</b> where all the black-market weapon trades go down.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, what exactly are we looking for?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Redheaded troll, goes by the name of <b title='if sb is glum, they feel unhappy and do not talk a lot ↗gloomy'>Glumly</b>. According to the message boards, if you wanna move stolen goods and it's after school hours, he's your guy.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, we are. In the meantime, you're welcome to <b title='quickly make sth (to eat)'>whip up</b> a quick character and join us.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Seriously?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it's fun.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Maybe I should just go home.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Our troll just walked in! I got him!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We got him. We're almost done.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, how do you guys wanna play this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his <b title='an American premium cable and satellite television network [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO">Wiki</a>]'>HBO</b> and all their delightful original programming.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't care! I'm <b title='lose it - become very angry and upset'>losing it</b>, <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why don't we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, dear Lord.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I'll have sex with him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's not where it was going.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Good, because I would hate that.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Leonard, you're busy, let's talk tomorrow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?<br>
<i>Priya</i>No, no, I think it's sexy to date a boy trapped in a man's body.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good, good. I'll tell you what happens.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>People think I don't <b title='understand'>get</b> sarcasm.

<i>Amy</i>Well, well, well. Look who it is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, be nice.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Because I do that now.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Count your blessings you're not a Tanzanian chimp.<br>
<i>Priya</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Don't listen to her, she's had a lot of ice cream. Do you wanna join us?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the <b title='↗lounge'>lobby</b>?
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, no, don't put me in the middle of this. I'm not going to be your go-between.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?<br>
<i>Raj</i>There's no reason to worry.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's a relief.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights <b title='[<a href="">Wiki</a>]'>skyping</b> with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. No one can hide from me, not <b title='Where&#039;s Waldo?, the US/Canada name for Where&#039;s Wally?, a series of children&#039;s books by Martin Handford [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F">Wiki</a>]'>Waldo</b>, not <b title='an American media franchise of educational computer and video games, television series, books, and other media featuring a thieving villain of the same name [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego">Wiki</a>]'>Carmen San Diego</b>, not even topless <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman">Wiki</a>]'>Natalie Portman</b>.<br>

<i>Howard</i>Thanks. Our <b title='sb who has done sth wrong or against the law'>culprit</b> is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The name and the address drip with evil.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What else do we know about him?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, quite a bit, actually.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll bet he's some loser who lives with his parents.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, he does live with his parents. Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent! It's in a <b title='a road which is closed at one end'>cul-de-sac</b>. We can <b title='box in - prevent sb/sth from being able to move by surrounding them with people, vehicles, etc'>box him in</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on, you're thinking of going there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know if you've been following the news, Leonard, but there've been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No one's getting tortured.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine, we'll abide by <b title='The Geneva Conventions comprise four treaties, and three additional protocols, that establish the standards of international law for the humanitarian treatment of war.

<i>Raj</i>I totally had one of those.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who's with me?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I have a <b title='a music genre consisting of a stylized rhythmic music [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music">Wiki</a>]'>hip-hop</b> aerobics class at five, could we go after?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Also, tonight's the <b title='Saturday, considered as a day of rest and prayer in the Jewish religion and some Christian churches'>Sabbath</b> and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and watching <b title='an American television game show [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_%28U.S._game_show%29">Wiki</a>]'>Wheel of Fortune</b>, so, if we could leave at eight, we'd still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Leonard?<br>

<i>Raj</i>Oh, come on, man. Bros before... my sister.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw, <b title='fuck it'>screw it</b>. I'm in.<br>
