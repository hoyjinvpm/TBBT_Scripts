<s>Hallway outside High-IQ Sperm Bank.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, if a <b title='a particle of light [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">Wiki</a>]'>photon</b> is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed, it will not go through both slits. If it's unobserved, it will. However, if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone though both slits.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Agreed. What's your point?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's no point. I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.<br>
[At the reception desk]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Althea, the receptionist) Excuse me.<br>
<i>Althea</i>Hang on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Noticing she's doing a crossword puzzle) Uh, one across is "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean">Wiki</a>]'>Aegean</b>." Eight down is "<b title='a Russian-American novelist [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabokov">Wiki</a>]'>Nabokov</b>." 26 across is "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcm">Wiki</a>]'>mcm</b>." 14 down is... move your finger...<br>

Haiti.<br>
<i>Althea</i>Can I help you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. (Looks at Sheldon) Um... is this the high-IQ sperm bank?<br>
<i>Althea</i>If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think this is the place.<br>
<i>Althea</i>Fill these out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. We'll be right back.<br>
<i>Althea</i>Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh, wait.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I don't think I can do this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at <b title='an American fast casual, franchised restaurant chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuddruckers">Wiki</a>]'>Fuddruckers</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get <b title='A fractional T1 line is a T1 digital phone line in the North American T-carrier system that is leased to a customer at a fraction of its data-carrying capacity and at a correspondingly lower cost.

<i>Sheldon</i>I know, and I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> <b title='want sth a lot =long'>yearn</b> for faster downloads. But there's some poor woman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm. What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an <b title='Integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve, defined by f(x), between two points [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#Integral_calculus">Wiki</a>]'>integral or a differential</b> to solve the area under a curve?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sure she'll still love him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wouldn't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, what do you want to do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I want to leave.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's the <b title='a system of rules about the correct way to behave on an official occasion'>protocol</b> for leaving?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know- I've never <b title='go back on'>reneged</b> on a <b title='offer'>proffer</b> of sperm before.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let's try just walking out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bye. Nice meeting you.
<s>The staircase of their apartment building.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you still mad about the sperm bank?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='used to say "no" in a less strong way'>Not really</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters, most people will trip.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't care. Two milli... that doesn't seem right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, it's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father broke his <b title='collarbone'>clavicle</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is that why they sent you to boarding school?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. That was a result of my work with lasers.<br>
(They see Penny through an open door)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>New neighbor?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Evidently.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Significant improvement over the old neighbor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>200-pound <b title='sb who wears clothing typical of the opposite sex =cross-dresser'>transvestite</b> with a skin <b title='an illness or health problem that affects you permanently or for a very long time<br>
'>condition</b>? Yes, she is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We don't mean to interrupt. We live across the hall.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's nice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, uh, we don't live together. I mean, we live together, but in separate,<b title='=straight ≠homosexual, gay'>heterosexual</b> bedrooms.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor. Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Leonard. Sheldon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>All</i>Hi. Hi. Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, uh... oh, uh, welcome to the building.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thank you. Maybe we can have coffee sometime.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. - Well, uh, bye.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bye. Should we have invited her for lunch?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. We're gonna start season two of <b title='an American science fiction franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica">Wiki</a>]'>Battlestar Galactica</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We already watched the season two dvds.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not with <b title='a series of comments, explanations, or annotations'>commentary</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think we should be good neighbors and invite her over, make her feel welcome.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We never invited <b title='In French, nouns ending in -e tend to be feminine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_grammar#Gender">Wiki</a>]'>Louie-slash-Louise</b> over.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well... and that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on <b title='a social networking service [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">Wiki</a>]'>Myspace</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, and you've never met one of them.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's the beauty of it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm gonna invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and... chat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Chat? But we don't chat. At least not offline.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it's not difficult. You just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To what end?<br>
(Leonard knocks on Penny's door)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi. Again.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Anyway, um... we brought home Indian food (Shows her the bag). And, um... I know that moving can be stressful. And I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural <b title='food or medicine that you take to make you go to the toilet'>laxative</b>, and I don't have to tell you, that, you know, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I'm no expert here, but I believe in the context of a <b title='a formal lunch'>luncheon</b> invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh... yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what do you guys do for fun around here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, today we tried masturbating for money.

<s>Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Penny) Okay, well, make yourself at home.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're very welcome.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Notices a whiteboard) This looks like some serious stuff. Leonard, did you do this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, that's my work.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. Well, it's just some <b title='a branch of physics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Wiki</a>]'>quantum mechanics</b> with a little <b title='a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">Wiki</a>]'>string theory</b> <b title='draw shapes, lines, or patterns without really thinking about what you are doing'>doodling</b> around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke. It's a <b title='humorous imitation'>spoof</b> of the <b title='the computation of the energy and the wavefunction of an average-size molecule in quantum chemistry [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-Oppenheimer_Approximation">Wiki</a>]'>Born-Oppenheimer approximation</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Amazed) So you're like one of those <b title='an unauthorized biography of Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_%28book%29">Wiki</a>]'>Beautiful Mind</b> genius guys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>This is really impressive.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Holy smokes. If by "holy smokes" she mean a <b title='derived from sth else, not original'>derivative</b> restatement of the kind of stuff you can find <b title='write sth quickly and untidily'>scribbled</b> on the wall of any men's room at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT">Wiki</a>]'>MIT</b>, sure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit, broken-hearted"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't invent them. They're there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>In what universe?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In all of them... that is the point.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh... do you guys mind if I start?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um... Penny... that's where I sit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, sit next to me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No... I sit there.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's the difference?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's the difference?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='said when sth bad starts happening again'>Here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause <b title='sweat'>perspiration</b>. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide as to create a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax">Wiki</a>]'>parallax</b> distortion</b>. I could go on, but I think I've made my point.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do you want me to move?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just sit somewhere else.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. (Tries to find somewhere to sit)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, sit!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Sits down) Ah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, this is nice. We don't have a lot of <b title='guests'>company</b> over.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not true. Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over all the time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, I know, but...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tuesday night we played <b title='Kilngon is a language; Boggle is a word game [<a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Klingon_Boggle">Wiki</a>]'>Klingon Boggle</b> till 1:00 in the morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I remember.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I resent you saying we don't have company.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That has negative social implications.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I said I'm sorry!<br>
<i>Penny</i>So... Klingon Boggle?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. It's like regular Boggle, but... in Klingon. That's probably enough about us. So, tell us about you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um... me? Okay. I'm a <b title='sb who was born between November 23 and December 21 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_%28astrology%29">Wiki</a>]'>Sagittarius</b>, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. It tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Participate in the what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think what Sheldon's trying to say is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah. A lot of people think I'm a <b title='Cancer; Scorpio; Pisces. Fire sign: Aries; Leo; Sagittarius [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_sign#Polarity_and_the_four_elements">Wiki</a>]'>water sign</b>. Okay, let's see, what else. Oh, I'm a vegetarian. Except for fish. And the occasional steak. I love steak!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, uh, do you have some sort of a job?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah. I'm a waitress at the <b title='a distributor of cheesecakes in the United States. It is also a restaurant company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecake_Factory">Wiki</a>]'>Cheesecake Factory</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh... I love cheesecake.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're <b title='a type of sugar found in milk'>lactose</b>-intolerant.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't eat it- I just think it's a good idea.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. <b title='anyway'>Anyways</b>, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L. A. From Lincoln,<b title='a state on the Great Plains of the Midwestern United States. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska">Wiki</a>]'>Nebraska</b>,to be an actress and <b title='end up'>winds up</b> a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, it's based on your life.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I'm from <b title='the largest city in the state of Nebraska [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha">Wiki</a>]'>Omaha</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, if that was movie, I would go see it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else... um... guess that's about it. That's the story of Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it sounds wonderful.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Mouths) What's happening?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Mouths) I don't know.<br>
<i>Penny</i>God, you know, four years I lived with him. Four years- that's like as long as high school.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It took you four years to get through <b title='it is usually either grades 9-12 or grades 10-12. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school#United_States">Wiki</a>]'>high school</b>?<br>
(Leonard motions "cut it out")<br>
<i>Penny</i>It just... I can't believe I trusted him. (Gets up and heads for the kitchen to get some tissues) (Sheldon quickly takes the now vacant spot)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Sheldon, quietly) Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You? No, you'll only make it worse.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating <b title='the essentials'>guts</b>... I still love him (Starts to cry). Is that crazy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's not crazy. It's uh... uh... it's a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox">Wiki</a>]'>paradox</b>.Paradoxes are part of nature. Think about light. If you look at it <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens">Wiki</a>]'>Huygens</b>, light is a wave, as confirmed by <b title='a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">Wiki</a>]'>the double-slit experiments</b>, but then along comes <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Wiki</a>]'>Albert Einstein</b> and discovers that light behaves like particles, too. (To Sheldon) Well, I didn't make it worse.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm so sorry. <b title='if sb is a mess, they look dirty and untidy, or are in a bad emotional state'>I'm such a mess</b>. On top of everything else, I'm all <b title='disgusting'>gross</b> from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Our shower works.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's right down the hall.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. You guys are really <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> (Heads for the bathroom).<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, this is an interesting development.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's not true. Remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with <b title='a disease (AD) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease">Wiki</a>]'>Alzheimer's</b> had that <b title='an event or a short period of time during which sth happens'>episode</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off, after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The worst part was watching her <b title='cut meat'>carve</b> that turkey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That woman in there is not going to have sex with you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male and she's a female.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but not of the same species.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here. I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, of course.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's not to say that if a <b title="relating to sex or sb's body">carnal</b> relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. <b title='no matter how'>However</b> briefly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your <b title='a fictional character in the Star Wars universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker">Wiki</a>]'>Luke Skywalker</b> no-more-tears shampoo?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's <b title='a fictional character in the Star Wars universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Wiki</a>]'>Darth Vader</b> shampoo. (Someone knocks on the door; goes to get it) Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait till you see this.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's fantastic, unbelievable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Wiki</a>]'>Stephen Hawking</b> lecture from MIT in 1974.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This isn't a good time.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Imitating <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-To-Speech">Wiki</a>]'>computer voice</b>) It's before he became a creepy computer voice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's great. You guys have to go.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's just not a good time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard has a lady over.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. And she's not a lady. She's just a new neighbor.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hang on, there really is a lady here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And you want us out because you're anticipating <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not anticipating coitus.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So she's available for coitus?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Technically, that would be "<b title='also known as the pull-out method [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coitus_interruptus">Wiki</a>]'>coitus interruptus</b>."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower...? Oh, hi. Sorry. Hello.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='nice to meet you'>Enchanté</b> <b title='miss'>mademoiselle</b>. Howard wolowitz, <b title=' California Institute of Technology [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltech">Wiki</a>]'>Caltech</b> department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work. It's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest <b title='an object similar to a small planet that travels around a planet'>moon</b> taking high-resolution digital photographs.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bonne douche.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm... I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's French for "good shower." It's a <b title='gentle feelings such as sympathy, love, etc'>sentiment</b> I can express in six languages.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Save it for your blog, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>洗个痛快澡。<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, there it goes. It sticks. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, thanks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're welcome. Oh, you're just going to step right... okay, I'll...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, leonard...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The hair products are sheldon's.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Um, can I ask you a favor?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A favor? Sure, you can ask me a favor. I would do you a favor for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's okay if you say no.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'll probably say yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I really think we should examine the chain of <b title='the relationship of cause and effect'>causality</b> here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Must we?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Event a - a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event b - we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query - on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, yes. Well, that may be the <b title='nearest, proximate'>proximal</b> cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists <b title='contrast/compared to'>in contradistinction to</b> the higher level <b title='ultimate cause [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation">Wiki</a>]'>distal cause</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Which is?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You think with your penis.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's a biological impossibility. And you didn't have to come.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watch Wolowitz try to <b title='talk to sb in a way that shows you are sexually attracted to them'>hit on</b> Penny in Russian, Arabic and <b title='Persian [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farsi">Wiki</a>]'>Farsi</b>. Why can't she get her own TV?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, you know how it is with breakups.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I don't... and neither do you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But- I, I broke up with Joyce <b title='金'>Kim</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You did not break up with Joyce Kim. She <b title='leave your own country or group in order to go to or join an opposing one'>defected</b> to North Korea.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a <b title='a loud angry argument, esp in a public place'>scene</b> with him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, we <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> have a scene with him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
<s>Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>(to Raj) So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university? (No response) Um, I'm sorry. Do you speak English?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, he speaks English. He just can't speak to women.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?
<s>Kurt's apartment building lobby.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll do the talking.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let's... (To Kurt) Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV.<br>
<i>Kurt</i><b title='{rude} go away'>Get lost</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, thanks for you time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not going to give up just like that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, the TV's in the building. We have been denied access to the building, <b title='therefore'>ergo</b>, we are done.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me. If I were to give up on the first little <b title='a small problem'>hitch</b> I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the <b title='the effects and results of sth bad or important'>aftermath</b> of the Big Bang.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My apologies. What's your plan? (Leonard pulls the door violently) (Sarcastically) <b title='show your appreciation of sb/sth'>It's just a privilege</b> to watch your mind at work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360. We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.<br>
[Two little girls buzz at the door, and someone lets them in]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you think their combined IQ is?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just grab the door!<br>
[The hallway]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This is it. I'll do the talking.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good thinking. I'll just be the <b title='body guards, enforcers, etc'>muscle</b>.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>(He is big) Yeah?<br>
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>From the intercom.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>How the hell did you get in the building?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh... we're scientists.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tell him about our IQ.<br>
[The lobby. Leonard and Sheldon are not wearing their pants.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My mom bought me those pants.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're gonna have to call her.
<s>The staircase of Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's okay. It wasn't my first <b title="pants - to pull down an individual's bottom-wear, exposing their underwear. A form of public humiliation.">pantsing</b> and it won't be my last.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And you were right about my motives. I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have someday led to sex.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, you got me out of my pants.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's <b title='too good for me'>out of my league</b>, I'm done with her. Got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't think like that. You're not going to die alone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, sheldon. You're a good friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
<s>The living room of Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>(Showing Penny a computer game) This is one of my favorite places to <b title='relax'>kick back</b> after a <b title='a long search for sth that is difficult to find'>quest</b>. They have a great <b title='house wine - ordinary wine that is provided by a restaurant to be drunk with meals'>house</b> <b title='a type of beer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale">Wiki</a>]'>ale</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, a cool tiger.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is <b title="button - a woman's clit, g-spot etc">buttons</b>. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sounds interesting.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So you'll think about it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(To Howard) <b title='awesome; cool'>Smooth</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're home.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my god, what happened?<br>
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his <b title='good wishes'>regards</b> and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm so sorry. I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an <b title='a stupid, annoying person'>ass</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it was a valid hypothesis.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That was a valid hypo...? What is happening to you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really... thank you so much for going and trying. (Hugs them) You're just... Oh, you're so terrific. Really. Why don't you get some clothes on, I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're not done with her, are you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Our babies will be smart and beautiful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not to mention imaginary.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They're both curry-based cuisines.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It would be <b title='relating to the art of cooking good food or the pleasure of eating it'>gastronomically</b> <b title='not necessary'>redundant</b>. I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Any ideas, Raj? (No response)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That sounds like fun.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Singing) Baby, baby, don't get hooked up on me / Oh, baby, baby, don't get hooked up on me...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Leonard) I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a <b title='real'>veritable</b> <b title='a virile (strong, active, and full of sexual energy) man [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Daddy_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>Mack Daddy</b>.
