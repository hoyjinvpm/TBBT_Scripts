<s>The Apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, your food's getting cold.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Working) I'll eat later. Right now, I'm <b title="suckle - suck milk from a breast ↗breastfeed, nurse">suckling</b> at the informative bosom of mother physics.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let me see.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, you can pick your <b title="sb's stock of clothes">wardrobe</b>. You can even choose your <b title="bag, belt, jewellery etc">accessories</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we've bought over the years. It would be kinda cool to have ones that look like us. Don't you think?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool, you should get one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, so, I'm out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would it come with <b title="The hands were molded in a softer plastic that allowed the fingers to grip objects in a more lifelike fashion.">Kung-Fu grip</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't waste my time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You get that these are personalized action figures.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Honey, if you want one, just get one.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're still out, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yep.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>A <b title="period of silence">hush</b> falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He's dividing both sides by I. He's adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He's plugging that back in. He takes the <b title="The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity (a function or dependent variable) which is determined by another quantity (the independent variable). [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative'>Wiki</a>]">derivative</b>, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nobel. Kripke. Don't look at my board. (Turns it around)<br>
<i>Kripke</i>What's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's a drawing of a really cool train. Yeah, don't look at that, either. What do you want?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>I have some bad news. You're working on a <b title="grant proposal">gwant pwoposal</b> fow a new fusion <b title="reactor">weactow</b>. I'm working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So they asked you to pack up your things and <b title="leave">ship out</b>. That's <b title="used as a way of saying that you are sorry about sth, usu in an ironic way">hard cheese</b>, Barry. You're one of the good ones.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>No, they're making us work together.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so <b title="intended for a small group of people who are especially intelligent, rich, powerful, etc =rarefied">rarified</b> you couldn't even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
<s>Howard's lab.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser. (Removes the picture to reveal a burnt spot on the wall)<br>
<i>Raj</i>They're here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I've ever spent.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Easy. His family's <b title="very rich">loaded</b>, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both <b title="breasts">fun bags</b> and money bags.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I'm not dark chocolate. I'm melt-in-your-mouth <b title="burnt sugar used for coloring and flavoring food">caramel</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, man. Look at my nose.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe it's a shipping problem.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Maybe <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Snipes'>Wiki</a>]">Wesley Snipes</b> and <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan_Sam'>Wiki</a>]">Toucan Sam</b> just got action figures that look like you guys.<br>
<i>Raj</i>This sucks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I can't believe I wasted all that money.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look <b title="showing too much satisfaction with your own cleverness or success">smug</b>? I feel smug.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Penny</i>I hate it when you make me sit through all <b title="the list of all the people involved in a movie">the credits</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, sometimes there's a secret ending, like in <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers'>Wiki</a>]">The Avengers</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but I don't think that's gonna happen in a documentary about <b title="the killing of millions of Jews by the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s">the Holocaust</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They could show <b title="a short sequence of a film or video production, usually a deleted scene, containing a mistake made by a member of the cast or crew [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blooper'>Wiki</a>]">bloopers</b>. Oh, no.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That is Sheldon's "I'm unhappy and about to destroy the planet" music. Come on, let's just go to your place.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, wait, if he's unhappy,shouldn't we talk to him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Shouldn't we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Entering apartment) You doing okay, sweetie?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There is <b title="suggesting that sth bad is about to happen; threatening">ominous</b> music playing, and there is an <b title="type of loose sheepskin coat">afghan</b> over my head. I don't know where you're from, but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Want me to make you some tea?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tea is for when I'm upset. I'm not upset. The university's forcing me to work with Kripke. I'm outraged.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, cocoa?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it's like to be paired with someone who's so incredibly annoying?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, teacher! Me! Me!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See, I did all this great work, and now he's just gonna come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What beverage do you make for that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Kripke</i>What the <b title="frig - fuck">fwig</b>, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And yet, now you're in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the <b title="an arena for steel-cage jousting in the Australian post-apocalyptic film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderdome'>Wiki</a>]">Thunderdome</b>, Kripke.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why don't you show me yours first.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>You think I just <b title="fell off the turnip truck - ignorant, unsophisticated">few off the turnip twuck</b>? We exchange at the same time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>How do I know you're not going to do that with mine?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, because I'm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. <b title="zinger - a clever humorous remark that might also be insulting">Zingers</b> fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Are we gonna do this or not? (The exchange envelopes) Thank you. So, we wead each other's work, meet again tomowow?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Kripke</i><b title="Nice try. This is a blank paper">Nice twy. This is bwank paper</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here.<br>
<i>Kripke</i><b title="say or produce sth reluctantly">Cough it up</b>, Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very well. (Gives him another envelope)<br>
<i>Kripke</i>If this one's bwank, too, I'm gonna be fuwious.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. (Yet another envelope)
<s>Howard's lab. Raj is playing himself.</s>
<i>Raj</i>You! Always bet on black.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Get that waste of money out of my face.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's only a waste of money if we don't play with them. (As doll) He's right, <b title="a friend. also 'dog'">dawg</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please, I'm working.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah? How's that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it's three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I have always wanted a 3-D printer.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course you have. They're an engineer's dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, but they're so expensive.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, come on. You deserve one. You've worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, the prices have been coming down.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, true. They're practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my <b title="'computer-aided design">CAD</b>/<b title="computer-aided manufacturing">CAM</b> designs, specialized tools-<br>
<i>Raj</i>Not to mention <b title="a 21-mile long beach community in Los Angeles County, California [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California'>Wiki</a>]">Malibu</b> Koothrappali and his totally <b title="excellent">bitching</b> dream house.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We don't need Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really, smart guy? Where's he supposed to park his sweet little <b title="a sports car [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette'>Wiki</a>]">Corvette</b>?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>The monkey in my tobacco study has <b title="take to sth/doing sth - begin to do sth as a habit">taken to</b> smoking a pipe. I'm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You've been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm fine.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, what's going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I read his research, and, it's <b title="by leaps and bounds - by large movements forward">leaps and bounds</b> ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I'd thought. It's his mommy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do we have to lose?<br>
<i>Amy</i>How's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I feel like I'm being strangled by a <b title="a large snake that is not poisonous, but kills animals by crushing them">boa constrictor</b>. (She releases him) Why'd you stop?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, Sheldon, we're gonna be late.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't go in today. I'm sick.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're not sick. You just don't wanna face Kripke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, look.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title="53.3 °C">128</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did you do, put this in your tea?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear. Now I'm not even smarter than you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, don't play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, geez. What a <b title="sb who complains a lot">grouch</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
<s>Howard's lab.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I think this thing was made in China.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Eh, what can you do?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, I, I think it's done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents <b title="used when each of sth costs a particular amount of money">a pop</b> at a party store.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, I wish I was in better shape.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Stop holding your stomach in. I'll give you a <b title="abs">six-pack</b> with the computer.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Kilmer'>Wiki</a>]">Val Kilmer</b> as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, you can suck it in a little bit.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Kripke</i>Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is <b title="way">weawy</b> not at a wevew I expected it to be.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Don't <b title="play">pway</b> dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We do?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>You have a girlfwiend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>So, my work would <b title="suffer">suffew</b> too, if I was <b title="get laid - have sex">getting waid</b> all the time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I'm getting.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>You wucky bastard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to <b title="buckle down - start to do sth seriously">buckew down</b> and focus.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll do what I can. But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas <b title="make sth become a thick soft mass">mush</b> together, boy <b title="hello">howdy</b>, is it magic.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, good, you're home. Got a little surprise for you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Say hello to my little friend.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, my God. That's so cute. I didn't think there could be <b title="He is short">a smaller version of you</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, Howie, I love these.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I thought you might.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Were they expensive?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>How?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>$5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>At any point, did it <b title="if a fact dawns on you, you realize it for the first time">dawn on</b> you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's kind of dawning on me now.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't believe you. Howie, we can't afford to waste money on junk like this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, but we're married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, here's how love works. You're gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>All right, I don't understand. Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous <b title="used for emphasizing that sb who does sth bad is not ashamed or does not try to do it secretly, blatant">bald-faced</b> lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and <b title="whimsical - unusual or strange and often amusing">whimsically</b> <b title="↗creative">inventive</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is my coitus whimsically inventive?<br>
<i>Penny</i>That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You ever gonna sleep with Amy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's awfully personal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We don't ask Sheldon things like that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper <b title="jostle - knock or push roughly">jostling</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, we're down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then what's the problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_examination'>Wiki</a>]">prostate exams</b>. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a possibility.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Under breath while hitting Leonard) Oh, my God! (Out loud) Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Penny hit Leonard several times) Ow!
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Are you sure you wanna do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. And can you please <b title="make out - write out or complete a form or document (Raj is writing a check)">make that out</b> to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow, that's harsh.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title="used to say that you already know how bad sth is, esp because you have experienced it yourself">Tell me about it</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Aren't you gonna eat lunch?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nah, I blew my food allowance on <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon'>Wiki</a>]">Pokemon</b> cards.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, the equation balances, but it's certainly not elegant.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Whatever. You get any <b title="last">wast</b> night?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Gave it to her <b title="adv (informal) well">good</b>, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put-<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing <b title="lingerie">wingewie</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't notice.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>How could you not notice?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Ah, you're kiwing me, Cooper!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can we get back to work?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_toy'>Sex toy</a>]">toys</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>A wocket? You'we a fweak! I wove it!
