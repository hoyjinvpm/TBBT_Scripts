<s>The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz's house.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Almost there. You're doing great.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Please hurry.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>(Off) I don't need a treadmill.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The doctor says you need to get exercise.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I get plenty of exercise.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Crushing my will to live isn't exercise.<br>
<i>Raj</i>If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She'll use it. All I need is to <b title="fix">rig</b> it with a fishing pole and a <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoneyBaked_Ham'>Wiki</a>]">HoneyBaked Ham</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right. Now what?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>We set it up in Howie's old room.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do you know how to set it up?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle- Ma, look out.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>So she's gonna <b title="have to stay in bed because you are ill or injured">be laid up</b> for at least six weeks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Poor Mrs Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Should we do something for her?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. Let's go see the new Spider-Man movie.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, we're talking about your friend's mother. She got hurt.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It's called <b title="read the room - understand what the people around you are thinking">reading the room</b>, Amy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, how were things on the set?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, pretty good, actually.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So the movie's not as bad as you thought?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I'm just gonna go in every day and give it my all.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Good for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. There's no reason why I shouldn't be the best bisexual <b title="a woman whose job is to dance in a sexually exciting way wearing very few clothes">go-go dancer</b> slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone's ever seen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List is tough to beat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know.
<s>Mrs Wolowitz's house.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, she's all settled in the guest room.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You mean a forklift?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sorry. I just can't deal with this right now.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I would do it for my mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, of course you would, you're a loving person. I'm what my people would call a <b title="fool, idiot; penis">putz</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Look, I'm not <b title="like very much">crazy about</b> the idea, but what other choice do we have?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who's used to suffering and unpleasant smells.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You'd hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That's so cruel.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>(Off) I need to <b title="pee">tinkle</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You are a putz.<br>
<i>Howard</i>As <b title="advertise - make known">advertised</b>.
<s>A cinema.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thanks for coming with me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose <b title="a very infectious disease that causes spots on the skin">herpes</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is that a real thing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, until they invent nose condoms, I'm not finding out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Emily, Hey.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Oh, hey, Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Um, you know what? I better go. My movie's about to start.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you here alone?<br>
<i>Emily</i>No, not really.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you mean, not really?<br>
<i>Man</i>Hey, should we get our seats?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I'll call you later.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That was awkward, right?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is it because she's dating you but was out with that other fellow?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
<s>The movie set.</s>
<i>Director</i>And action.<br>
<i>Wil Wheaton</i>Please don't shut me out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Go away. Just go away.<br>
<i>Wil</i>I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?<br>
<i>Wil</i>I was trying to save your life.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Life? What life? Look at me, I'm a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don't know.<br>
<i>Wil</i>You can't give up. I love you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I love you, too. But I'm afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.<br>
<i>Director</i>And cut. All right. All right, let's set up for the next scene.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.<br>
<i>Director</i>Let's just move on. No one cares.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I care. I mean, look, if we're gonna do this, why not try and make it something we're actually proud of?<br>
<i>Director</i>Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, 'cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn't be in it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa, whoa, hang on. There's no need to insult her.<br>
<i>Director</i>And who are you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm her boyfriend.<br>
<i>Director</i>Isn't she too hot for you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A little, yeah.<br>
<i>Director</i>Well, boyfriend, get off my set.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You can't do that. He's with me.<br>
<i>Director</i>You know what? You can get off my set, too. You're fired.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? You can't fire me. I'm the star. I'm the girl that <b title="go bananas - become mad or angry">goes bananas</b>. It says so on the poster.<br>
<i>Director</i>Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this. (Grabs a mask)<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hey, if you're gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.
<s>A bar.</s>
<i>Wil</i>Wow, that fell apart really fast.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn't sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, quite all right. After my forehead <b title="a serious type of skin cancer caused esp by the light of the sun">melanoma</b> scare I've learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don't have all the ingredients to make <b title="mixed-spice tea [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai'>Wiki</a>]">chai tea</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You don't have to make me anything.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I do. You're upset about Emily and you're Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom'>Wiki</a>]">cardamom</b> seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry, I left them in my <b title="a long piece of cloth wrapped around the head, worn esp by Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim men">turban</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That's close enough. You know, I'm curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wouldn't you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can't happen. We have an <b title="an ironclad agreement, proof, defence etc is so strong and sure that it cannot be changed or argued against. clad- wearing a particular type of clothing">ironclad</b> relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But you don't have sex with her, either.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title="being good at persuading people, often in a way that does not seem honest ↗smooth, slippery, sly">Slick</b>, huh?<br>
<i>Raj</i>To be truthful, Emily and I haven't dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you had intercourse?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, <b title=" keep your position even though people attack or criticize you">stick to your guns</b>. There will be a lot of pressure.
<s>Mrs Wolowitz's house.</s>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>(Off) I'm hungry again.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's like the world's fattest <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_clock'>Wiki</a>]">cuckoo clock</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You know, you're always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it's gonna be like.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, it's not.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We're even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe you're right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm just telling you now, if we do have kids, don't expect me to do all the work.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I'm a very paternal person. I'd be excellent at taking care of a baby.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I'm still hungry.
<i>Howard</i>I'm coming, you big baby.
<s>The bar.</s>
<i>Penny</i>You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Forget it, man, it's crap. You just move on to the next thing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say. You used to be famous.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hey. I just lost a job for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, I'm sorry, you're famous.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Penny, it's not about being famous. It's about the art. It's about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado'>Wiki</a>] ↗shark, tornado">Sharknado</b> 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.<br>
<i>Penny</i>God, what am I doing with my life?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You having second thoughts about acting?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You were on set, you saw what it was like.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, but it's not always that bad.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, really?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was over a bowling alley.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, but there was ample parking.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you done?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And you were so good in the TV commercial.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was for haemorrhoid cream.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on. How can you be sad when you're going home with all <b title="1.68m">five-foot-six</b> of this?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hmm. You think you're five-foot-six, that's funny.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>I don't understand it. I'm a nice guy, I have a great job, I'm well-educated, come from a good family. Why don't women wanna be with me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>An interesting question. Well, good night.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What? Don't send me home. I can't be alone right now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's your problem. You can't be alone.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How many women have you had dates with?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Eleven.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon'>Wiki</a>]">Sailor Moon</b> girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, now do you see the problem?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Maybe. I, I don't know.It's late, I should, I should go. Look, I-I do get what you're saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was trying to suggest chemical <b title="castrate - remove the testicles of a male animal or a man">castration</b>, but it's my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
<s>Mrs Wolowitz's house.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie, I'm back!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Shh, I just got her to sleep.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Queen? I've been killing myself here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I'm nice, I wanna take care of people.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I'm glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Thanks for letting me come over.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course. Please, come in.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I wanna make sure that we're okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh, look, you and I haven't made any commitments to each other.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he's been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's okay.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Really?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that's my issue, not yours.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I'd be pretty upset.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Just so you know, I'm not seeing anyone else.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, me neither.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay. Please. (Motions for her to sit down) So, uh, you, you have tattoos?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.<br>
<i>Emily</i>That's cool.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?<br>
<i>Emily</i>One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's, uh, been a long time since I've seen a girl's really not her shoulder.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos? (They kiss)<br>
<i>Raj</i>But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some <b title="crunch - sit-up">crunches</b>.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God. What a day.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can I get you anything?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. I need to start making some smart decisions.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>With your career?<br>
<i>Penny</i>With my life.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. We could get married.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, be serious.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I am.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why? Because I'm a, a smart decision?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So I'm like a <b title="the outside of the grain of a cereal">bran</b> muffin.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, that's not what I'm saying.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's exactly what you're saying. I'm the boring thing you're choosing because I'm good for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What does it matter? The point is, I'm choosing you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it matters a lot. I don't wanna be a bran muffin. I, I wanna be a <b title="Cinnabon Classic – the original Cinnabon cinnamon roll [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabon#Foods'>Wiki</a>]">Cinnabon</b>, you know? A strawberry <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts'>Wiki</a>]">Pop-Tart</b>. Something you're excited about even though it could give you diabetes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no. No, it's too late. I'm your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what? Forget it. I never should've brought it up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know I wanna marry you, but you're only doing this because you got fired and you're feeling sorry for yourself.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could've happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don't need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then what do you need?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You, you stupid Pop-Tart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Then I guess I'm in.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? You guess you're in?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not like, I guess I'm in. Like I guess, I'm in!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Cool.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So is that it? Are, are we engaged?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I think so.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not sure. Just feels a little <b title="anticlimax - an event or experience which causes disappointment because it is less exciting than was expected or because it happens immediately after a much more interesting or exciting event">anticlimactic</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, it kinda does, huh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I know. This might help.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Where did you get a ring?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh my God, yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This would've been so much more romantic if you didn't have monkey hair on your finger.
<s>Mrs Wolowitz's house.</s>
<i>Howard</i>How you feeling?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Last night was a little rough, but I think we're gonna get through this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm proud of us.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Me too.<br>

<i>Foreign Nurse</i>Coming, Mrs Wolowitz!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You were right.<br>
