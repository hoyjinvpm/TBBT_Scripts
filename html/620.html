<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it <b title="revert - return to a former state or condition">reverts</b> to its <b title="sexless">asexual</b> state and then grows up again.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican <b title="sb who takes care of a child or an adult who is sick or unable to care for themselves">caregiver</b> proved us all wrong.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of <b title="sth which is undifferentiated is not split into parts, or has different parts but you cannot tell the difference between them">undifferentiated</b> <b title="the living contents of a cell [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplasm'>Wiki</a>]">protoplasm</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I could keep my Gmail account, I'd be okay with that.<br>
<i>Barry</i><b title="Hello, fellas">Hewwo, fewwas</b>.<br>
<i>All</i>Hey Barry.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman's office was?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Barry</i>Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's terrible.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Barry</i><b title="in lieu of - instead of">In wieu of</b> fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of <b title="Febreze is a brand of household odor eliminator [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febreze'>Wiki</a>]">Febweze</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish, I'd be okay with <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_shrimp'>Wiki</a>]">brine shrimp</b> or the history of the unicycle.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Show a little compassion, a man died.<br>
<i>Barry</i>And turned into a <b title="puddle">puddew</b> of <b title="sticky wet substance">goo</b>. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the <b title="latter">watter</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become <b title="too confident and relaxed">complacent</b>. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Pchew!<br>
<i>Barry</i>If you need my nose, you'll find it <b title="firmly">firmwy</b> <b title="wedged">wodged</b> up the <b title="rectum - the terminal portion of the large intestine">qectum</b> of the tenure committee.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You Ph.D's gonna go <b title="be very nice to sb in authority so that they will treat you well">suck up</b> like Kripke?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. I mean, I'll apply, but I'm not gonna <b title="bend forward and down">stoop</b> to playing politics.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can't get tenure, I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raj, don't <b title="hang loosely and swing or sway to and fro">dangle</b> false hope in front of Leonard like that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified as you are.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So, tenured means a job for life?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yup.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You can't get fired even if you're bad at it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mm, not really.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>While I disagree with the <b title="an idea or theory on which a statement or action is based">premise</b> of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn't <b title="make sth become less, lessen">diminish</b> my output. You know, I'm like the sun. Can't turn this off.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mm-hmm.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Do they know they don't <b title="have a chance">stand a chance</b> 'cause you're so great?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title="Expressed well">Well put</b>. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you <b title="having a chance to win">in the running</b>.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Money from family does come with <b title="special conditions">strings</b> attached.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you're gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, <b title="one's father">old man</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I think that's enough wine for now.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.<br>
<i>Penny</i>She'd be proud, huh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Or, the chainsaw.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant's back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm gonna make some coffee.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So, who do you have to <b title="talk informally with sb, esp in a way that is not sincere or to gain some advantage for yourself">schmooze</b> to get this deal?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not gonna schmooze anybody. I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's great. That shows a lot of integrity.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. I'm a naive idiot, right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, good, you heard me.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should <b title="try to become friendly with sb in order to get some benefit for yourself">cozy up to</b> the people making the decision.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title="used for saying that you are not surprised by what sb has told you">You don't say</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to know who's on the committee. Let's see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Is that a problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well-<br>
(Flashback to <b title="612.html">Series 6, Episode 12, The Egg Salad Equivalency</b>)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Even you. You're a slave.<br>
<i>Janine</i>I'm a what?<br>
(End of flashback)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not sure, it could go either way.
<s>The university gymnasium.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Dr. Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Good for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've got what my father used to call furniture disease. <b title="↗chest of drawers">My chest is falling into my drawers</b>. I'm not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?<br>
<i>Janine</i>You push start.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. This one might be broken.<br>
<i>Janine</i>You have to move.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I'm feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you're on that-that tenure committee?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Yep. I gotta get a home gym.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'll be <b title="throw/toss your hat in the ring - do sth that makes it clear you want to compete with other people, esp to compete for a political position">throwing my hat in the ring</b>.<br>
<i>Janine</i>All right, I'll <b title="watch for the arrival or appearance of sb/sth">keep an eye out for</b> that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in... ever.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Go away.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Janine the Machine, <b title="let's">wet's</b> do this!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Hey, Barry.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, look at that. Burned a whole <b title="unit for measuring the energy value of food. An ounce of sugar has about 100 calories.">calorie</b>.<br>
<i>Barry</i>I guess you got here <b title="early">ewwy</b> to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.<br>
<i>Barry</i>No, my pweasure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I've got a-a great recipe. The trick is in fresh ground, I'll e-mail it to you.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Aw wight, I'm warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Let's go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's enough <b title="any type of exercise that makes the heart stronger and healthier, for example running">cardio</b> for me. I'm just gonna stretch out before I hit the <b title="weight - a piece of metal that weighs an exact amount and is lifted by people as a sport">weights</b>.<br>
<i>Janine</i>You okay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Call someone.
<s>Janine's office. There is a sound on her computer. It opens up an online video.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don't be alarmed, I'm not really in space. <b title="anyway">Anyhoo</b>, I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Oh, come on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Born in New Delhi, the third son of an <b title="travelling from place to place">itinerant</b> gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.<br>
<i>Shelldon</i>(Off) (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis?<br>
<i>Janine</i>God, they're everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, hello. I'm fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Uh, Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's too late. Get ready to like me.<br>
<i>Janine</i><b title="Roots: The Saga of an American Family is a novel [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family'>Wiki</a>]">Roots</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um... Well... You are black, right?<br>
<i>Janine</i>This meeting has come to an end.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because you wanna start watching it right now. <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure'>Voice procedure</a>]">Copy that</b>. (Leaves) Let's see. Up next on the tenure committee is... Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Gentlemen.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Where have you been?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nurse's office.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Asthma attack?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I'm fine, though.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You guys going to Professor Tupperman's memorial?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Probably not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Barely knew him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, you wouldn't want to look like you guys are <b title="brown-nose - try to make sb in authority like you by being very nice to them">brown-nosing</b> the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that's what I was hoping for, <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat'>Wiki</a>]">meerkats</b>.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab'>Wiki</a>]">Q-tips</b> to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>First of all, when you say things like that, people think you're crazy. Second, the reason I'm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.<br>
<i>Amy</i>It sounds like a long and tedious evening.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I'd rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee's going to be there.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Of course it would. I'm <b title="knowing a lot about sth">well-versed</b> in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your <b title="personal reputation or status; confidence or credence">stock</b> as a candidate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Do anything interesting today?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, Sheldon's going to be there? We all promised we weren't gonna go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, what a jerk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, since Amy's going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, that's nice, but it-it's just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I'm not sure how much help you'd be.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. I'm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Sees her butt) Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, then you all can get tenure.
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. (To his dog) This is so humiliating. I've got to get tenure. (On phone) Okay, let-let's meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? (To his dog) Looks like we're both going to be living like animals.
<s>The memorial.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Let's <b title="examine; review">go over</b> our emotional responses one last time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sad.<br>
<i>Amy</i>The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn't make us <b title="bad-tempered">cranky</b> and <b title="feeling afraid because you are in a small or crowded space or in a place that seems difficult to get out of quickly">claustrophobic</b>. It makes us?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Glad.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bad. However-<br>
<i>Amy</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Bad.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me. I'm here to pay my respects to Professor <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupperware'>Wiki</a>]">Tupperware</b>, or whatever his name is.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, well, well, Sheldon, <b title="enjoy">fancy</b> meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn't having a <b title="a formal dance">cotillion</b> after all. And you, you said you weren't coming here, either.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I have a thick accent. You don't know what I said.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'd like to know why Penny's here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm here to support my man, just like you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you going to do? Take people's drink orders and get them wrong?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do it. (Penny takes off her coat)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What? Did she do it yet?<br>
<i>Amy</i>She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to <b title="help sth progress or be successful ↗promote">further</b> Leonard's <b title="aim, principle or movement">cause</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do. Don't just stand there. Take your breasts out.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ooh, meerkat fight!<br>
<i>Amy</i>You're all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Way to hit 'em <b title="with as much energy as possible">with both barrels</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, because that was not clear.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What? That was ambiguous.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, now it's biguous. What are you gonna do about it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...<br>
<i>Howard</i>You could talk some <b title="offensive speech">smack</b> about his mother.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know what you're doing, but I was about to <b title="say sth unpleasant in an indirect way">insinuate</b> that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you do what you want, but I don't wanna lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So is tenure.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Walk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're right. This is <b title="↗take the high road - do whats the most acceptable ethically">beneath</b> me. (To Sheldon) Like your mother was last night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How about it, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you think I should do?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, you'll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you'll make any more friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't want any more, but let's go.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.<br>
<i>Janine</i>I could not ask you to do that.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Nonsense. Childwen <b title="love">wove</b> me. Something about me just makes them <b title="laugh">waugh</b> and waugh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. We cannot lose to that jerk.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, <b title="exclamation of abandon">screw it</b>. I'm going in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I'm going in is what I said to your mother last night. (To Amy) Don't worry, I didn't really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and <b title="unpleasant; disturbing; disconcerting">off-putting</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Should've taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
<s>Janine's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? I know you're in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.<br>
<i>Janine</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.<br>
<i>Janine</i>You didn't bring another gift, did you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Anyway, thank you.<br>
<i>Janine</i>You're welcome. I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, <b title="absolutely right">right on</b>, sister.
