<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>What you doing?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You said clean up. I'm cleaning up.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You can't just throw everything in the closet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can't do both. This isn't sex.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What if someone looks in there?<br>
<i>Howard</i>They're just coming over for dinner. No one's gonna look in the closet.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, you don't know that. What if someone's looking for the bathroom and they open that door?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Could work out. For all we know there's a toilet in there somewhere.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Fine. But after tonight we need to <b title="find a way to understand a situation in order to control it">get a handle on</b> this mess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Are you kidding? He's like a <b title="sb of great learning, scholar ↗academic">savant</b> at organizing. You know, everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you'll see a label that says label.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He's our guest, we can't just ask him to <b title="make sth tidy">straighten</b> our closet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, we wouldn't ask him. We'd just show him the closet and let the <b title="goblin - a creature in children's stories that looks like a small person and enjoys causing trouble">goblins</b> in his head take it from there.<br>
[Later.]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, guys, come on in.<br>
<i>All</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ooh, it smells good.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, you shouldn't have.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, it's my pleasure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, you really shouldn't have. I brought my own.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You stopped and got him takeout?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, now don't you feel silly.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Show him the closet.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>These <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll'>Wiki</a>]">spring rolls</b> are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by color?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Color's fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend a little time with Amy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it. The other day at <b title="an American foods supermarket chain [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market'>Wiki</a>]">Whole Foods</b>, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an <b title="artisan - skilled manual worker">artisanal</b> <b title="cured sausage [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami'>Wiki</a>]">salami</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
<s>The closet.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, come on. It's getting late. Time to go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, five more minutes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let's move it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How come I never get to do anything I wanna do?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please, Leonard, he said it's okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, it's, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Juggle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You health nuts kill me.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, my God, it's beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whoa, you opened this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or <b title="things that you collect because they are connected with a person or organization in which you are interested">memorabilia</b>. Now, as I was saying, based on the content-<br>
<i>Howard</i>I couldn't be less interested. Now, come on, I'll take you home.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, don't you wanna know what's in the letter?<br>
<i>Howard</i>If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let's get out of here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do whatever you want.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thanks. (To Bernadette) Oh. Great party.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his <b title="the bag of skin containing a man's testicles">scrotum</b> out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is your point?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? You couldn't just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Trying to paint a picture.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Although-<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie, you okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it's not worth it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's this stupid letter.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Did you read it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You must be curious.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Of course I'm curious. I haven't seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What's that about?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why don't you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it)<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Really? Are you sure?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Feel better?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>I can't believe he set it on fire.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day 'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don't know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Boy, I'm really curious what was in that letter.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Me too, but I guess now we'll never know.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I can't do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?<br>
<i>Bermadette</i>That works.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.
<s>The laundry room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building's belly button.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?<br>
<i>Amy</i>You have something we want.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, we just want information.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Oh, I've got that <b title="to a great degree, or in large amounts">in spades</b>. <b title="rob and plunder ↗ravish">Ravage</b> me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What did it say?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't tell you that. I'm bound by closet organizer/organizee <b title="a situation in which important information must be kept secret ↗Non-disclosure agreement">confidentiality</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, that's not a real thing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies. You know. That doesn't stop you from pawing at me like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By <b title="chance">happenstance</b>, I <b title="come to do sth - do sth by chance">came to know</b> it. That doesn't give me the right to <b title="spread abroad">disseminate</b> it freely.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, obviously.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well played. Sometimes I don't give you enough <b title="praise">credit</b>, Penny.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, all I did was invite you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, put your mind at ease. I'm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard's dinner party's ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I'm thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge'>Wiki</a>]">Moulin Rouge</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm thinking you need a <b title="a male hormone that causes a stage of growth in older boys and change in their reproductive organs">testosterone</b> <b title="adhesive patch to administer medication to the skin [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch#Science_and_medicine'>Wiki</a>]">patch</b>. Penny and I just wanna do something <b title="without much activity or reaction">low-key</b>. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, <b title="a food item served before the main courses of a meal [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hors_d%27oeuvre'>Wiki</a>]">hors d'oeuvres</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So your theme is I saw a <b title="film or program that is shown or broadcast again">rerun</b> of <b title="an American period drama television series [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men'>Wiki</a>]">Mad Men</b> and bought some <b title="a ball of crab meat that has been deep-fried in batter [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_puff'>Wiki</a>]">crab puffs</b> from <b title="an American privately held chain of specialty grocery stores [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe%27s'>Wiki</a>]">Trader Joe's</b>? Hate to miss that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, where have you been?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Leonard. You know, if I was <b title="having a tendency; inclined">prone</b> to sarcasm, I'd say I was <b title="pull off - succeed in doing sth that is difficult">pulling off</b> a major <b title="robbery">heist</b> at the museum of laundry baskets.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, <b title="used to to express mild surprise or wonder">golly</b>, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, well, I was <b title="waylay - wait for and stop (sb who is passing), esp in order to rob him or to ask him for sth ↗ambush">waylaid</b> by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What information?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry, <b title="badger - persuade sb by telling them repeatedly to do sth, or to question sb repeatedly ↗nag, pester">badgering</b> me won't work. What you should have said is, It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine, then that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, I'll tell you. My goodness, everyone's on their game today.
<s>The apartment kitchen.</s>
<i>Amy</i>This is really fun.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, and the hors d'oeuvres are delightful.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>As is the company.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, let's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Absolutely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin <b title="wild party, usu with a lot of drinking and/or sexual activity">orgy</b> music?
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, try doing it in heels.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I am.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wait. There's something I have to tell you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I know what was in your dad's letter.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Sheldon grabs her as a human shield) Hey.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I made him tell us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What? Us? Who else knows?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Same here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Shame on all of you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, too.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Couldn't leave him one friend, could you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>So everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, it's six against one. <b title="step down, particularly from the witness stand in a courtroom">Stand down</b>, sir.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Bernadette) How could you do this?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>If you want, we could tell you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I don't want to know. I mean, I do, but- I gotta go.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Use me as a human shield!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I panicked. <b title="He is wearing heels.">He looked taller than usual</b>.
<s>The closet.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>(Off) Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>In here.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm sorry. I should've left it alone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's okay. Sorry I ran off like that.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What are you looking at?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's nice.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I gotta tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for <b title="blab - tell people about sth that should be kept secret">blabbing</b>, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with <b title="a traditional African style of hair grooming where the hair is braided very close to the scalp [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornrows'>Wiki</a>]">cornrows</b>. <b title="Neither African nor Jew">Neither race</b> was happy to see me with those.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Think you could take a break?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Got a little surprise for you. Come on.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I mean, I'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it- Oh. What are you guys doing here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When you left, you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah, what's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a <b title="large enough to be perceived or examined by the unaided eye">macroscopic</b> example of <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition'>Wiki</a>]">quantum superposition</b>. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of <b title="an obvious truth that is either being ignored or going unaddressed">the elephant in the room</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an <b title="report/description">account</b> of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don't tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of <b title="of, relating to, or involving knowledge; cognitive">epistemic</b> <b title="ambivalent - feeling two different things about sth at the same time">ambivalence</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. And I said if it wasn't epistemic, we might as well not do it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sit down, honey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj, you're up.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a <b title="a single-panel comic [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Far_Side'>Wiki</a>]">Far Side</b> card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it's a fly. Silly frog. So funny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nice try. That's the plot for <b title="a 1985 American adventure–comedy film [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies'>Wiki</a>]">Goonies</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Told you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You didn't know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Or that's complete <b title="nonsense">poppycock</b> which Amy made up. It still could be the map.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was. Eventually, his other life <b title="catch up - involve, often unwilling">caught up</b> to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would like to change mine. The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it's completely different from Goonies.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, it's not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bernadette.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. I'm terrific.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, which one do you think it is, matey?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Actually, I don't wanna know. I want all of them to be true.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, one of them is.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's pretty cool. Thank you, guys.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, it's still early. Why don't we go back and have that party?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, cool.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette's diary has some <b title="referring to sex in a way that is funny">saucy</b> passages.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sheldon, don't you dare.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's nothing to worry about. Your secret's safe with me.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i><b title="used to say that sth is better, more correct, or more enjoyable than sth else">That's more like it</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Although copyright law would allow me to quote <b title="snippet - small piece">snippets</b> in the context of a review.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Glad you're feeling better.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Me too. If I'd known we were gonna be dancing, would've worn my flats.<br>
<i>Penny</i>This turned out pretty well, huh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I think so.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I agree. That is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.<br>
<i>Amy</i>If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you're keeping this dead goldfish?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dildo'>Dildo</a>]">battery-operated chew toy</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Party's over! Party's over!
