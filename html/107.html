<i>Howard</i>Watch this, it's really cool. (To his phone) Call Leonard Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Phone</i>Did you say: "Call Helen Boxleitner"?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. (Slowly) Call Leonard Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Phone</i>Did you say: "Call Temple Beth Seder"?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey-hey, let me try it. Call McFlono McFlooloon.<br>
(Leonard, Howard and Raj smiles)<br>
<i>Phone</i>Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj is upset; his phone rings)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, it's very impressive. And a little racist.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If we're all through playing "<b title='make fun of'>mock</b> the flawed technology, " can we <b title='be doing, working or succeeding'>get on with</b> <b title='a multi-billion dollar military science fiction video game [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)">Wiki</a>]'>Halo</b> night? We were supposed to start at 8:00. It is now 8:06.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So we'll start now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We could split it two, two and two.<br>
<i>Howard</i>If we're having <b title='a type of fish <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Antonio_Sicurezza_-_Still_life_with_anchovies.jpg/300px-Antonio_Sicurezza_-_Still_life_with_anchovies.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchovy">Wiki</a>]'>anchovies</b> on the pizza, we can't take it out of bathroom time.<br>
(Someone knocks on the door. Leonard gets it, revealing Penny)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, what fresh hell is this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, Penny. Come on in.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='"find a penny pick it up and all the day you&#039;ll have good luck"; pick up - successfully attract (a girl)'>See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.</b><br>
<i>Penny</i>(Not amused) No, you won't. Uh, can I <b title='↗hang out'>hide out</b> here for a while?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. What's going on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, there's this girl I know from back in <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Nebraska_in_United_States.svg/270px-Nebraska_in_United_States. svg.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska">Wiki</a>]'>Nebraska</b>, Christy. Anyway, she called me up, and she's like, "hey, how's California?" And I'm like, "awesome, " 'cause, you know, it's not Bebraska. And the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>8:08.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Anyway, she got here today and she's just been in my apartment <b title='yakety yak - noisy talk'>yakety yakking</b> about every guy she slept with in <b title='the largest city in the state of Nebraska [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha">Wiki</a>]'>Omaha</b>, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Intrigued) Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she throw it all in... like some sort of erotic <b title='a thick soup made from fish, vegetables and spices'>bouillabaisse</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To Leonard) He really needs to <b title='decrease the intensity of his speech or behavior'>dial it down</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know. So if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst. Who needs Halo, when we can be <b title='regale - entertain'>regaled</b> with the delightfully <b title='friendly and informal'>folksy</b> tale of the <b title='↗tramp, prostitute'>whore</b> of Omaha?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I don't think she's a whore.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, yeah, she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards. This one time she was at... where's Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(From Penny's apartment) <b title='Hello, miss'>Bonjour, mademoiselle</b>. I understand you're new in town.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='used when you are slightly surprised or annoyed'>good grief</b>.
<s>The hallway. Penny, Sheldon, Raj, and Leonard stand; hearing music from Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Aw, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not one-on-one. (In disgust) One-on-one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great idea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. The wheel was a great idea, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity">Wiki</a>]'>relativity</b> was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather <b title='of poor quality'>sucky</b> one at that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, what, what, what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve. There are <b title='very many'>myriad</b> weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely <b title='containing many small parts or details that all work or fit together ↗delicate'>intricate</b> backstory.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Takes the controller and presses a button) Oh cool. Whose head did I just blow off?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I <b title='get - understand'>got</b> this. <b title='prepare to file. "After an ammunition clip was loaded into the rifle the bolt automatically moved forward in order to "lock" a round into the chamber.

<i>Leonard</i>It's the only way we can play teams.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but whoever's her partner will be <b title='hamstring - make it very difficult for sb to take any action'>hamstrung</b> by her lack of experience, and not to mention the fact...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Huh, there goes your head again.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, it's not good <b title='↗fair play'>sportsmanship</b> to shoot somebody who's just <b title='if a character in a computer game respawns or is respawned, they are born again after being killed'>respawned</b>. You need to to give them a chance to... (Penny blows off his head again) now, come on!<br>
[Time lapses]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raj, Raj! She's got me cornered. Cover me!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Cover this, <b title='sb who sucks. suck - be bad at sth'>suckers</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, you are <b title='performing well'>on fire</b>!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, and so is Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, <b title='that does it - used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>. I don't know how, but she is cheating. No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game. (Storms off)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back. You forgot something.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>This <b title='[<a href="http://halowiki.net/p/Plasma_Grenade">Wiki</a>]'>plasma grenade</b>. look, it's raining you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Gosh, he's kind of a <b title='sb who does not take defeat well'>sore loser</b>, isn't he?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, to be fair, he's also a rather unpleasant winner.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, it's been fun.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, Penny, we make such a good team. Maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Or we could just <b title='It means getting out and just doing things, seeing places, having fun. [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100620110630AAYtjip">link</a>] ↗FRIENDS, S2E5, S6E2, and S8E19'>have a life</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I guess for you that's an option.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>As usual, nice talking to you, Raj. (Closes the door and leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you suppose she meant by that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's an <b title='mystery'>enigma</b>, Raj.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well established...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's gone, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, she could have said goodbye.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters again) Okay, I have a problem.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's called <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome">Wiki</a>]'>carpal tunnel syndrome</b>, and quite frankly you deserve it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, um, Howard and Christy are...kind of <b title='hook up - have sex'>hooking up</b> in my bedroom.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, I grew up on a farm, okay? From what I heard, they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, yeah, take the couch, or my bed. I just got new pillows. <b title='hypo - less than usual. ↗allergic, generate'>Hypoallergenic</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The couch is good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hold that thought. Leonard, a moment. (Motions for Leonard to go to the kitchen counter)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let me guess. You have a problem with this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where do I begin?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, first, we don't have <b title='sb who stays in a home as a guest'>houseguests</b>. Frankly, if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Your friendship means a lot to me as well. What else?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well... our earthquake supplies. We have a two-man, two-day kit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So if there's an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might <b title='give in'>succumb</b> to <b title='cannibal - sb who eats human flesh'>cannibalism</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No one ever thinks it'll happen until it does.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's engaging in <b title='reduction to absurdity [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">Wiki</a>]'>reductio ad absurdum</b>. It's the logical <b title='false reasoning or argument'>fallacy</b> of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result. (To Leonard) And I do not appreciate it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, well, since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's <b title='look at or check'>go over</b> the morning schedule. I use the bathroom from 7:00 to 7:20. Plan your <b title='washing yourself, cleaning your teeth, etc'>ablutions</b> and <b title='related to the body'>bodily</b> functions accordingly.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I suggest no liquids after 11:00 P. M.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Pats the blanket and pillow) <b title='here you are'>Here you go</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks, Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wrong.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm listening.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your head goes on the other end.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient <b title='thing that is essential or urgent'>imperative</b> of protecting oneself against <b title='a person or animal that goes from one place to another looking for something to kill or steal'>marauders</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Deadpan) I'll risk it. Anything else should I know?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry about that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the <b title='a strong transparent plastic used instead of glass'>Plexiglas</b> case under the UV light.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Got it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, sleep tight.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Funny expression, "sleep tight." It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on <b title='joined together'>interlocking</b> ropes, which would occasionally... (Penny looks at him) sleep tight.<br>
(Raj is in the kitchen, eating a piece of toast. He tiptoes towards the door, waves goodbye using the piece of toast, closes the door, and then leaves. Penny, awakend by the sound, gets up and lies down in the reverse direction)
<s>Next morning, the living room.</s>
(Sheldon, with a bowl in his hand, goes over to the couch from the kitech, tries to sit at his spot, notices Penny is still sleeping, hesitates for a while, tries to sit next to Penny's head)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Runs off to Leonard) Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a <b title=' there are 8 ounces in 1 cup so 1/4 of 8 ounces would be 2 ounces. fluid ounce - a unit for measuring liquid, equal to 1/20 pint or 0.028 litres in Britain, and 1/16 pint or 0.03 litres in the US'>quarter cup</b> of <b title='It refers to the fat content of the milk. Unaltered milk usually has 3.25 % to 4.0% fat.'>two percent</b> milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America, and watched <b title='a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Wiki</a>]'>Doctor Who</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny's still sleeping.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know, I know. You have a TV in your room. Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because I am neither an <b title='sb weakened through illness or injury'>invalid</b>, nor a woman celebrating <b title='In the United States, it is the second Sunday in May.'>Mother's Day</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, what time is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Almost 6:30.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I slept all day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, it's 6:30 in the morning.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What the hell is your problem? (Lies down)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity. I now have a bowl of <b title='shred - cut or tear into small pieces'>shredded</b> wheat paste.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Enters, in a purple bathrobe) <b title='Spanish "hello"'>Hola</b>, <b title='amigo - Spanish "friend"'>nerd-migos</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why do you people hate sleep? (Notices Howard) Are you wearing my robe?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy?<br>
<i>Howard</i>In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that <b title='a long rough sponge-like piece of plant fibre which you use to scrub your body <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Luffa_aegyptica.jpg/220px-Luffa_aegyptica.jpg">'>loofah</b> <b title='mitten'>mitt</b>? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You, you used my loofah?<br>
<i>Howard</i>More precisely, we used your loofah. I <b title='exfoliate - remove dead cells from the skin'>exfoliated</b> her brains out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You can keep that, too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh. Well, then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.<br>
<i>Christy</i>(From outside the door) Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>In here, <b title='used in the past by servants for talking to a woman with a high social status'>milady</b>!<br>
<i>Christy</i>(Enters) Hmm. There's my <b title='The Little Engine that Could is an illustrated children&#039;s book [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could">Wiki</a>]'>little engine that could</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Chugga-ghugga, chugga-chugga...<br>
(She runs over to him and they hug passionately)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.<br>
<i>Christy</i>(To Leonard) Hi. Christy. (She holds out her hand, and they shake hands)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm Sheldon. (They shake hands)<br>
<i>Christy</i>Right. You're Howard's <b title='all those who accompany and attend an important person'>entourage</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, so, Christy, what are your plans?<br>
<i>Christy</i>Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills">Wiki</a>]'>Beverly Hills</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, no, I meant plans to find someplace to live. You know, other than with me. <b title='used to say you are not suggesting sth'>Not that</b> I don't love having you, but it's... it's a little crowded.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, terrific. Now we're running a cute little <b title='Bed and breakfast, a type of accommodation'>B&B</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let me offer a little <b title='Thinking outside the box (also thinking out of the box or thinking beyond the box) is a metaphor that means to think differently, unconventionally, or from a new perspective. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box">Wiki</a>]'>outside-the-box thinking</b> here. Why doesn't Christy stay with me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For one thing, you live with your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do not. My mother lives with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, then it's all settled. Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who. Although at this point, it's more like doctor why bother?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you just can't <b title='tell sb exactly what to do and how to behave'>dictate</b>...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No more talking! Everybody go!<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, what do you say? You wanna <b title='go to another place'>repair to</b> <b title='Spanish "home"'>casa</b> Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Christy</i>What is that, like a Mexican <b title='delicatessen - a store that sells food such as cooked meat, cheese, and food from other countries'>deli</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sorry, I should've mentioned this earlier. My last name is Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Christy</i>Oh, that's so cool. <b title='my first Jew who I have had sex with'>My first Jew</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I imagine there aren't very many <b title='kosher food is prepared according to Jewish law'>kosher</b> <b title='Nebraska - "Cornhusker State" [<a href="http://www.50states.com/bio/nickname3.htm#.U4s1eHaTSxg">link</a>]'>cornhuskers</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But you're still taking me shopping, right?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Anything you want.<br>
<i>Christy</i>Okay, I'll go pack my stuff. (Runs off)<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Penny and the guys) When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, can't you see she's using you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Who cares? Last night, she pulled off her blouse and I <b title='↗weep, swept'>wept</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, Howard, I know her. Okay? She'll have sex with anyone, as long as they keep buying her things.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yay! <b title='say politely that you need to leave'>If you'll excuse me</b>, I have some <b title='a ceremony that takes place on the thirteenth birthday of a Jewish boy, after which he is regarded as an adult'>bar mitzvah</b> <b title='↗stocks, shares, securities'>bonds</b> to <b title='exchange a check etc for cash'>cash</b>. (Leaves)
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let me <b title='walk through - guide deliberately through'>walk you through</b> it. Our standard order is: The steamed <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Wiki</a>]'>dumpling</b> appetizer, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Tso%27s_Chicken">Wiki</a>]'>General Tso's chicken</b>, beef with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli">Wiki</a>]'>broccoli</b>, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable <b title='撈麵 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_mein">Wiki</a>]'>lo mein</b>. Do you see the problem?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I see a problem.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Our entire order is <b title='based'>predicated</b> on four dumplings and four <b title='the main dish of a meal'>entrees</b> divided amongst four people. (Signals that Howard is absent)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, we'll just order three entrees.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. What do you wanna eliminate? And who gets the extra dumpling?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We could cut it into thirds.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then it's no longer a dumpling. Once you cut it open it is, at best, a very small open-faced sandwich.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's putting his needs ahead of the <b title='of, by or relating to a group or society as a whole'>collective</b> good. Where (Points at the waiter) he comes from, that's punishable by death.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>I come from <b title='the capital city of the U. S. state of California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento">Wiki</a>]'>Sacramento</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>No substitutions.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This isn't a substitution. It's a reduction.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Okay. No reductions.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. Uh, bring us three orders of dumplings. That's 12. We'll each have four.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That works.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. If we fill up on dumplings, we need to eliminate another entree.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>No eliminations.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And divide it how? <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend. If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork and she double-dips her <b title='Spring roll [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_roll">Wiki</a>]'>egg rolls</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We don't order egg rolls.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can we please make a decision? Not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving <b title='exactly'>right</b> here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's an idea. Why don't we just go out for Indian food?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>You're nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings fall to the floor. No one has to know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll know.<br>
(The waiter gets upset, says something in Cantonese (硬颈嘅...?) and leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>How about soup?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, we can always divide soup.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What about the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton">Wiki</a>]'>wontons</b>?
<s>The hallway. Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj are there. Leonard knocks at Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's Halo night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah? Okay. So?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy...<br>
<i>Penny</i>She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Care_Bears.png/200px-Care_Bears.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_Bears">Wiki</a>]'>Care Bears</b> all sweaty.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Penny... we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, but I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't go out; it's Halo night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You go dancing every wednesday?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then that's not "dancing night."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tonight is Halo night. It's like talking to a wall.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, now, Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, remember, we <b title='an exercise in which you pretend to be in a particular situation, especially to help you learn a language or deal with problems. also a verb'>role-played</b> this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, fellas, I gotta go. But good luck.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe we should've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's the Chinese restaurant <b title='In all respects'>all over</b> again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For god's sakes, Sheldon, you're driving me crazy!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your anger is not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's happening to us? We're <b title='if an organization, system or agreement falls apart, it fails or stops working effectively'>falling apart</b>.<br>
(Sheldon starts to dial some numbers into his phone)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who are you calling?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The only man who can restore any <b title='a situation, condition etc that is close to or similar to a particular one, usually a good one'>semblance</b> of balance to our universe.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(On phone) Hi, this is Howard Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Christy</i>And this is Christy Vanderbelt.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!<br>
<i>Christy</i>You're not gonna put that on your message, are you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nah, I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.<br>
(The call is ended)
<s>In front of Howard's house.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, think this through. You're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and <b title='Halo 3 is a 2007 first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie for the Xbox 360 console. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_three">Wiki</a>]'>Halo three</b>. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include <b title='High-definition. definition - clearness of outline [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Def">Wiki</a>]'>hi-def</b> graphics and enhanced weapon systems.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My point.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>(From behind the door) I'm just saying, you can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while! Why, so you and Howard can <b title='have sex'>hump</b> on it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a <b title='ideas that are not extreme, and that people who oppose each other can agree about'>middle ground</b>.<br>
<i>Ladies</i>Shut up, Howard!<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know what, you guys talk. I'm gonna take my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter">Wiki</a>]'>scooter</b> out for a little <b title='a short trip in a car for pleasure =drive'>spin</b>.<br>
<i>Christy</i>You happy? You drove your own son out of the house!<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Comes out of the door) Hey, what are you guys doing here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's Halo night.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>He's not a man, he's a <b title='stupid person; penis'>putz</b>! And don't you take that tone with me, you <b title='an attractive woman who uses her looks to get money from rich men ↗cradle robbing'>gold digger</b>!<br>
<i>Christy</i>What'd you call me?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>You heard me! And I'll tell you something else, you're <b title='be mistaken about sth'>barking up the wrong tree</b>. 'Cause as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will!<br>
<i>Christy</i>You know what? I got better offers. I'm outta here.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>That's right. <b title='The Whore of Babylon or Babylon the Great is a Christian figure of evil mentioned in the Book of Revelation in the Bible. Her full title is given as "Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon">Wiki</a>]'>Go back to Babylon, you whore</b>!<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, Halo night, huh?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Puzzled) I thought she was the whore of Omaha.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Shh.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, you got him in your sights! Fire! He's charging his plasma rifle!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't shoot now. I'm <b title='hiding'>cloaking</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Now, Raj! Kill Sheldon!<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't see him!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's why they call it cloaking, dead man!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Start throwing grenades!<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm all out!<br>
(Penny and a bunch of girls enter)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys. My friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That road, Raj, shoot in the tank!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We said no tanks!<br>
<i>Raj</i>There are no rules in hell!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bring a <b title='medical'>med</b> pack! I need a med pack!<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To girls) Told ya. (They leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's a <b title='sb who shoots at people from a hidden place'>sniper</b>. Use your rocket launcher!<br>
<i>Raj</i>All I've got is a <b title='a mid-range weapon that fires pink needles that track enemies well at close to mid ranges [<a href="http://halowiki.net/p/Needler">link</a>]'>needler</b> and I'm all out of ammo!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And now you're out of life. Why'd you hit pause?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought I heard... something.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, never mind. Sorry. Go.<br>
