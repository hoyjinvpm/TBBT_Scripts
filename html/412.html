<s>The university cafeteria. Howard is on the phone.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Yeah, doesn't matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don't like the computer, don't use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Goodbye!<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah">Wiki</a>]'>Hanukkah</b> present you're regretting, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I won't say that all senior citizens who can't master technology should be publicly <b title='flog - beat a person or animal with a whip or stick'>flogged</b>, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I had a great idea. You know how we're always having to stop and solve <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation">Wiki</a>]'>differential equations</b>, like when you're doing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis">Wiki</a>]'>Fourier analysis</b>, or using the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Wiki</a>]'>Schrodinger equation</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, Leonard, that's actually a <b title='based on what is logical or true'>valid</b> idea. Very good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I'd have to give a slight <b title='advantage'>edge</b> to the cat. I'll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can't promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother's house.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Where would you go?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's that? Some weird sex thing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we'll have ourselves an app to sell.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sounds like we're in business.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Pressing button on camera phone. Camera makes a fart noise) Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear Lord, shush.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you're just gonna to <b title='tell sb sth that should be kept secret or private ↗spoiler'>spill the beans</b> in front of an outsider?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who, me?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Singing) The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's not going to steal our idea.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What idea?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're gonna write an application-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Singing) The <b title='↗lawn, meadow, grassland'>prairie</b> sky is wide and high, deep in the heart-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, stop, stop!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of Texas.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Whatever your secret is, I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bored.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Sheldon) Satisfied?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, wait a minute.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then it <b title='↗come up with'>hits</b> her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no <b title='chance of success'>prospects</b>, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hang on. Let's see where he's going.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That is ridiculous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, is it? Well let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, great. You know what? I've already <b title='mooch - get sth by asking sb to give you it, instead of paying for it'>mooched</b> dinner off you guys. I don't need to listen to this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>There's your answer, free food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, I've <b title='take the liberty of doing sth - do sth without asking permission'>taken the liberty of</b> drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh. Very clever. But still racist.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='the information received will get the attention and consideration it has due'>Duly noted</b>, Steve from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita">Wiki</a>]'>Wichita</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why am I listed as your executive assistant?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because the word secretary has fallen into <b title='state of having a bad reputation ↗disrespect'>disrepute</b>. FYI, my mother's birthday is coming up. I'm going to need you to pick up a present.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, we need to stop for a minute.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. (To Howard) And we'll need snacks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you're not in charge. It's my idea. I'm in charge.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You're clearly listed as founder.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh. Leonard's going all <b title='the first letter of the Greek alphabet'>alpha</b> nerd on Sheldon's ass.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. All right, I'm not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, <b title='used when turning command over to another officer. It was uttered several times in both Star Trek: The Original Series, and in Star Trek: The Next Generation.'>you have the conn</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.
<s>Later.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So, this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good one, boss.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly <b title='buoy up - make sb feel happier or more confident'>buoyed up</b> <b title='Sheldon'>this employee</b>'s <b title='feelings of loyalty, enthusiasm, and devotion to a group ↗morale'>esprit de corps</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not a joke. It's the real design.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I think this will work. Let's just try it my way.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I assumed that you wanted <b title='frank ↗blunt'>candid</b> truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless <b title='natter - chat ↗nag'>nattering</b> of <b title="calmly satisfied with oneself, one's work, etc">complacent</b> <b title='sb who always agrees with and obeys their employer'>yes-men</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you done?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you say so, boss.
<s>Later still.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized <b title='sb who is numerate is able to do arithmetic'>Numerator</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So it spells Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Does it? A happy accident.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not doing names now. Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Like I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, fine. If we're not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's just Sheldon backwards.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Another happy accident.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not wasting time with names right now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see. Is that decision open for discussion?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Again, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I <b title='demand'>call for</b> a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence">Wiki</a>]'>vote of no confidence</b> and an immediate change in leadership.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh Sheldon, stop it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's enough, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, let's get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, that's it, you're fired.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because you're impossible to work with.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see. And is that open for discussion?
<s>The following morning.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night. {"The Elves and the Shoemaker" is an often copied and re-made 1806 story about a poor shoemaker who receives much-needed help from elves.

<i>Leonard</i>But I fired you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I made it better.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't want it better. I want it my way.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that <b title='tell you a lot about sth/sb, without the need for words'>speaks volumes</b>, doesn't it? All right, I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell are bus pants?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your <b title='very tall'>lofty</b> heights <b title='at/on the top of'>atop</b> the corporate ladder, you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing's changed <b title='relating to sth you have just mentioned'>in that regard</b>. We're still roommates, we're still friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Except you identified me, your best friend, as a <b title='decaying because an injury or illness caused blood to stop flowing'>gangrenous</b> limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big <b title='short man syndrome [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_complex">Wiki</a>]'>Napoleon complex</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But, there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It means after we play handball, I'm showering at home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these. (Takes out two mugs out of a paper bag)<br>
<i>Raj</i>World's Greatest <b title='astrophysics - the scientific study of the physical and chemical structure of the stars, planets etc'>Astrophysicist</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't thank me. You earned it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Howard Wolowitz. Why not World's Greatest Engineer?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're not quitting on Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to <b title='increase the level of sth, esp demands or sums of money'>up the ante</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title="a design that is made using the first letters of someone's names ↗initial">Monogrammed</b> key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can <b title='a fabric or foam device that is designed to thermally insulate a beverage can or bottle [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_koozie">Wiki</a>]'>coosies</b> <b title='if sth is emblazoned with a name, design etc, it has that design on it where it can easily be seen ↗engrave'>emblazoned</b> with our university mascot? <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology">Wiki</a>]'>Go, Beavers</b>. I'll be back.

<i>Howard</i>Okay, let's try this one. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Spherical_Hankel_functions:_hn">Wiki</a>]'>Spherical Hankel function</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on. That's it!<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='a famous exclamation attributed to Archimedes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(word)">Wiki</a>]'>Eureka</b>!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. Let's say it together.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. The moment has passed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're actually scanning equations and getting good results.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn't wanna <b title='hinder, hamper'>impede</b> your progress.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. It's a little tricky. I'm gonna try having it <b title='identify, recognize'>pick up</b> the libraries dynam-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Playing the <b title='an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Wiki</a>]'>theremin</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Playing it. I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon! We're working here!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. (Leonard pulls out plug) Well, that was a little <b title='unkind or unfair'>uncalled-for</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, that was completely called-for. We need quiet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, your project is more important than mine?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't <b title='talk about sth for a long time without coming to the main point'>beat around the bush</b>, Leonard. If you don't want me here, just say the word, and I'll leave.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Could've beaten around the bush a little.
<s>The lobby. Sheldon is playing his theramin.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Singing) Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm practicing my theremin.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Singing) Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Glory, hallelujah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Something got you down there, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, honey, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He wouldn't drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is that so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. And they're still sticky.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Probably gonna have to throw them away.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>With you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Seriously, I have a great idea for one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's your app idea?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you don't like it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't say that. But no, I don't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its <b title='very stupid and showing no sympathy or understanding'>crass</b> consumerism and <b title='banal - boring, ordinary and not original'>banality</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And Leonard didn't wanna work with you? Imagine that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know, it's <b title='if sth baffles you, you cannot understand or explain it at all ↗bewilder'>baffling</b>. (Singing) Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you make it with milk or water?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Milk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Real cocoa?<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's what it says on the packet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you have those little <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow">Wiki</a>]'>marshmallows</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I suppose it's appropriate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What does that mean?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We've got a <b title='sb/sth that is very popular'>hit</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you think we should sell it for?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I'd say about a million dollars a <b title='used when each of sth costs a particular amount of money'>pop</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, what if we <b title='publish'>put out</b> a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's he doing in your apartment?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, he was <b title='mope - feel very unhappy and pity oneself'>moping</b> down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not playing. This is real work.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're gonna be hundred-aires.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we're doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Wait right here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that's the kinda girl I wanna take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? Leonard wants me back?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, we sure saw that coming.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know what I'm going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them <b title='become/be nervous, anxious or agitated about sth'>stew</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. You know, everybody's suffered enough. The thing is, you're gonna have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Say you're sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was being sarcastic.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you're sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the <b title='intended to make sb feel silly or ashamed'>withering</b> condemnation you and I will know it to be.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you're welcome.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, I'm getting good at this.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, now that you're back on the team, let's get you caught up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behavior and how much I respect and admire your leadership.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. (Sheldon winks at Penny) So, as you can see, not only can you store your favorite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I must say, I am impressed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We have.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let's start fresh. Howard, we're going to need some tea.
