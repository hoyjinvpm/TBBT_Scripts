<s>The stairwell. Leonard is carrying a large box.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it's very simple. In our <b title='not well organized'>ragtag</b> <b title='group ↗gang, flock, herd, school'>band</b> of scientists with nothing to lose, I'm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>One more floor, and I'd be the <b title='↗strain, spasm, twist, contraction'>pulled</b> muscle.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(In the apartment) Oh, it's about time, I'm starving.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't panic, this is better.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough <b title='the tough parts of vegetables and grains =fibre'>roughage</b> for a small city.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, sometimes I don't listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw <b title='best known for the title role in the 1960s ABC series Batman and its theatrical feature film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_West">Wiki</a>]'>Adam West</b>, so we followed him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who's Adam West?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who's Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>My guess is, "Hey, four minutes! New record!" That's why I'm the funny one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Anyway, we followed the guy to this <b title='an informal, irregularly scheduled event for the sale of used goods by private individuals [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_sale">Wiki</a>]'>garage sale</b>, and they had the coolest stuff.<br>
<i>Howard</i>They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. But there is an original final draft <b title='a 1984 American supernatural comedy film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters">Wiki</a>] bust - break/raid a house/arrest'>Ghostbusters</b> script with actual <b title='an unpleasant thick slippery substance'>slime</b> stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, my God. An <b title='an American sitcom [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>ALF</b> doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to <b title='the fictional planet and homeworld to the alien life form in the eponymously titled sitcom ALF. The eponymous character in a story has the same name as the title'>the planet Melmac</b>, and ALF was gonna bring him back to me. But he never did. Where's my daddy, puppet? Where is he?<br>
<i>Penny</i>That is so sad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, what's sad is that you don't know Adam West was TV's Batman.
<s>Contiuned from earlier.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Here's <b title='a fictional character in the Star Trek media franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock">Wiki</a>]'>Spock</b>'s head with no body. Here's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._T">Wiki</a>]'>Mr. T</b>'s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body with Mr. T's head. <b title='an American reality television series on TV Land starring Mr. T. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Pity_the_Fool_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>I pity the fool</b> who's <b title='↗illegal'>illogical</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on <b title='online dating website '>eHarmony</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, bye.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ooh, look, an <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones">Wiki</a>]'>Indiana Jones</b> <b title='a form of puzzle [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_the_dots">Wiki</a>]'>connect-the-dots</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And an <b title='a superhero appearing in comic book titles by DC Comics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman">Wiki</a>] ↗aquarium'>Aquaman</b> <b title='a poseable character figurine (a small model of a person or animal)'>action figure</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Looks like someone drew a penis on him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Huh? That'll come off. (Starts to rub it with his finger)<br>
<i>Howard</i>You see what you're doing? Stop that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fascinating.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It appears to be a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Wiki</a>]'>Lord of the Rings</b> ring.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's even got the <b title='of or relating to elves'>Elvish</b> <b title='a picture or design that has been cut into a surface'>engraving</b> on it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not Elvish. It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to rule them all.<br>
<i>Raj</i>One Ring to find them.<br>
<i>Howard</i>One Ring to bring them all.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And in the darkness bind them.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Holy crap, are we nerdy.
<s>The Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, I was doing some checking on the ring.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish <b title='very salty water used esp for pickling'>brine</b> with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchovy">Wiki</a>]'>anchovy</b>, oyster, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_bean">Wiki</a>]'>kidney bean</b> and grape.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, that's okay. I'll get it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the <b title='dirty or poor'>seedy</b> underbelly of the collectibles world.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Seedy underbelly?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, your black market <b title='a fictional weapon in the Star Trek fictional universe'>phasers</b>, your <b title='worn on screen'>screen-worn</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyota_Uhura">Wiki</a>]'>Lieutenant Uhura</b> panties, that kind of stuff.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Just a guy. I know a guy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is it Eddie Crispo?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I can't tell you who it is. Stop asking.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know lots of dangerous people, okay?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Name one.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of <b title='extreme tiredness'>exhaustion</b> and <b title='very'>ever so</b> slight amusement.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's not saying it's a magic ring. You're not, are you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, but it's close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Snatching it) Mine!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of <b title='of, relating to, or adjacent to the sea ↗nautical, marine, peacetime, wartime'>maritime</b> <b title='↗rescue, savage'>salvage</b> clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How is this maritime salvage?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Other than the lack of water, how is it not?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, it's tough to say since it's hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures-<br>
<i>Raj</i>Your guy Eddie Crispo?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, that's a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a <b title='a personal watercraft [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Ski">Wiki</a>]'>Jet Ski</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why do you want a Jet Ski?<br>
<i>Raj</i>All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can't just be a coincidence.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We can't sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-<b title='act in a play, story'>enact</b> our favourite scenes from the movies.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's sad how great that sounds.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Guys, it's stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a <b title='a fictional, diminutive, humanoid race who inhabit the lands of Middle-earth in J. R. R. Tolkien’s fiction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit">Wiki</a>]'>hobbit</b> in his next movie.<br>
<i>Raj</i>There are no Jewish hobbits.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on <b title='the Jewish New Year [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah">Wiki</a>]'>Rosh Hashanah</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We are not blackmailing Peter J- All right, where's the ring?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean my ring?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give me that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Look, let's be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a Jet Ski.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I found it. The ring is mine. I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You always get your way.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll <b title='form an agreement'>stipulate</b> to that if you give me the ring.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's delicious, the sarcasm's a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny <b title='hold on to - keep sth rather than losing it, selling it, or giving it to sb else'>holds on to</b> it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What ring?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This ring.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Looking for something?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's a <b title='sth used by actors in a play or movie ↗scene, wardrobe'>prop</b> from a movie, and we're <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> fighting over it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> keep it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you'd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How am I looking now?
<s>Penny and Leonard are asleep in Leonard's bed. Sheldon creeps in and tries to take the ring from round Penny's neck, but she turns over. He tries to make buzzing fly noises to get her to turn back, but she turns all the way the other way. He then uses an extender with a claw on the end to lift the ring from Penny's chest. As he tries to remove it, she wakes up, screams, and punches him in the face.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ow! You hit me! I'm bleeding! (Runs away)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What was that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's my girl.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, Sheldon, how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began <b title='in the uterus ↗womb'>in utero</b>. If only I'd had the presence of mind to <b title='re + absorb'>reabsorb</b> her, then I'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable <b title='a series of actions'>course of action</b> is to sell the ring and divide the money?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I was afraid of that. (Opens his laptop to reveal an Indian looking man on a webcam.) Go ahead.<br>
<i>Man on Screen</i>Greetings from <b title='also known as Bombay [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Wiki</a>]'>Mumbai</b>. I am Raj's attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Also my cousin.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You brought a lawyer?<br>
<i>Venkatesh</i>Don't answer that. I'll get straight to the point. My client's prepared to <b title='give up'>surrender</b> any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not giving him two Jet Skis.<br>
<i>Venkatesh</i>Look, we're big boys, why don't we just <b title='start to talk about the most important part of sth, without wasting time ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_chase">car chase</a>]'>cut to the chase</b> and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No Jet Skis.<br>
<i>Venkatesh</i>All right, forget the Jet Skis.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Forget the Jet Skis? That was our <b title='a point beyond which one will proceed no further [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_in_the_sand_%28phrase%29">Wiki</a>] ↗baseline, bottom line'>line in the sand</b>! What happened to "<b title='tear them a new asshole'>tear them a new one</b>?"<br>
<i>Venkatesh</i>What can I say? They <b title='play hardball - be very determined to get what you want'>played hardball</b>. We lost.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're useless.<br>
<i>Venkatesh</i>I told you that when you hired me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm signing off now.<br>
<i>Venkatesh</i>Call your mother, she worries.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, <b title='just to let you know'>just so you know</b>, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and <b title='awful, awesome'>awe</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn't wanna hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I'm sending it back. Where's the ring?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men's room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give me that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, it's mine.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's all of ours. (They begin to struggle over the ring.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, now, this is ridiculous!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then let go!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not letting go, you let go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. But can't we go home and start this?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure. Let go of the ring.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, it starts now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You do realize there's a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the <b title='formerly Sci-Fi Channel and SF [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy">Wiki</a>] ↗science, fiction'>Syfy Channel</b>. (They start to move away from the table while all still holding the ring.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wait, my laptop. (They go back for it.)
<s>The stairwell. The guys are coming up the stairs, all still holding the ring.</s>
<i>Howard</i>You know, there's a point when this becomes idiotic.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And it wasn't when we were driving like this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would advise the three of you that resistance is <b title='to/of no avail'>futile</b>. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of <b title='an American television romantic sitcom [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City">Wiki</a>]'>Sex and the City</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>There are six seasons, dude.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, crap!<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don't know if we can trust him again. It's a wild ride.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Door. (Leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, everybody, and <b title='bend (a ballet term) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_ballet#Pli.C3.A9">Wiki</a>]'>plié</b>. And <b title='rising onto the balls or toes of one or both feet'>relevé</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Appearing) Whatcha doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>FYI, this is a bag from <b title='the largest American retailer of lingerie [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria%27s_Secret">Wiki</a>]'>Victoria's Secret</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm out. (Goes to Penny's apartment)
<s>The apartment. The three guys are still holding the ring. Howard is on the phone.</s>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, he's doesn't! He's lying to you!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Will you be quiet?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I'm so glad we came to this <b title='sb who is not Jewish ↗pagan'>gentile</b> strip club! Howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the <b title='a disparaging term for a non-Jewish girl or woman. disparage - suggest that sb/sth is not important or valuable'>shiksa</b>'s <b title='a type of thong [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-string">Wiki</a>]'>G-string</b>!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll call you back.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I think it's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time, it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't you talk about my mother's boobies!<br>
<i>Raj</i>If you're offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's, boobies.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent, excellent. <b title='tire out - make sb very tired'>Tire each other out</b>, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why don't we go after your mother?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild <b title='a carbonated soft drink [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper">Wiki</a>]'>Dr Pepper</b> addiction. Anything you'd like to add?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's not gonna get you anywhere. Better pull out the big gun.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're right. Let's talk about your grandmother.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No! I call no <b title="Sheldon's nickname for his maternal grandmother">Meemaws</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't wanna hear this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then let go of the ring and walk away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Never.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right. I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Stop it!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I said stop it!<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're <b title='get to sb - annoy/affect sb'>getting to him</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Waterfalls!<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='affecting your mind in a way that you are not conscious of ↗subconscious, hypnotize'>Subliminal</b> messaging. I'm going to make you want to pee. Dripping <b title='↗tap water'>faucets</b>. Leaky <b title='an open pipe fixed to the edge of a roof to collect and carry away rain water'>gutter</b>. Peeing.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's, it's not working, dude.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh-ho-ho, it's working all right. I have to pee.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Then let go of the ring and go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, actually, I wouldn't mind going, too.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up, or do we pee?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We stand up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent choice.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Three.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Something tells me this was a bad day to wear <b title='a type of leather with a napped ( nap is the raised (fuzzy) surface on certain kinds of cloth) finish. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suede">Wiki</a>] ↗absorbent, patent leather'>suede</b> shoes.
<s>Sometime later. The guys are on the <b title='couch, sofa'>settee</b>. Howard is seen asleep, he is not holding the ring. The camera pans along to where Sheldon and Raj still hold the ring. Raj, also asleep, lets go and <b title='↗snuggle'>cuddles</b> up to Howard.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've done it! I've won! The ring is mine! It's mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We're going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into <b title='a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien&#039;s legendarium [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum">Wiki</a>]'>Gollum</b>. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where's the ring?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.<br>
<i>Raj</i>The fires of <b title='a fictional volcano [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Doom">Wiki</a>]'>Mount Doom</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand. It wasn't ours.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You quit the game! You had no right to take it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, so then we start the game over until there's a winner.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There wasn't ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, <b title='unkind and caring too much about small unimportant things'>petty</b> person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? 'Cause if it is, fine, I don't want anything to do with you. And I don't know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! (Goes to his bedroom. Takes a box from under his bed. Takes out the ring.) My precious.
<s>Leonard and Penny are asleep in Leonard's bed. The extender and claw reaches across and pulls down the sheet revealing the ring on a chain round Leonard's neck.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I knew it. Give us the precious!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>NEVER!<br>
(They begin to struggle, both shouting "give it", "give it to me" and "it's mine" at various intervals. Penny gets out of the bed and heads out the door.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
