<i>Leonard</i>Will you please turn your shirt off?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What? I'm giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I'm awesome and to be feared.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, right, there's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who's got music <b title='blast - make a loud harsh noise'>blasting</b> from between his nipples.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Stuart, what's going on?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Well, you might wanna mark your Google calendars. <b title='an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, media producer, television host, actor, voice actor and former president and chairman of Marvel Comics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">Wiki</a>]'>Stan Lee</b> is coming to do a signing on Thursday.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did he finally write a <b title='a book, movie, play, etc that continues the story of an earlier one ↗prequel'>sequel</b> to his autobiography? I'm sure ages 79 through 87 were just <b title='full of exciting events and activity'>action-packed</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his <b title='a doctor who studies and treats skin diseases'>dermatologist</b> and Stan's doing him a favor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I don't wanna know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for <b title='stellar - connected with the stars. inter- - between'>interstellar</b> flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of <b title='↗infectious'>contagious</b> skin disease?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, look who thinks he's Stuart's uncle now.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can't believe it. We're gonna meet Stan Lee! (Presses play on his iPod. His shirt starts to play "I'm So Excited" by <b title='an American R&B recording girl group [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pointer_Sisters">Wiki</a>]'>the Pointer Sisters</b>. He dances.)<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sad to say I taught him those moves.

<i>Leonard</i>I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my <b title='an American comic book series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_into_Mystery">Wiki</a>]'>Journey into Mystery</b> 83, first appearance of Thor or my <b title='a superhero comic book [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four">Wiki</a>]'>Fantastic Four</b> number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom.

[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!">Wiki</a>]'>Jeopardy!</b> plays.) Alex, I'm gonna go with what is... you're a dumbass? (Raj's shirt blows a <b title='a rude sound that you make by putting your tongue out and blowing'>raspberry</b>.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month's Batman.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, <b title='although'>albeit</b> confusing, <b title='an object that is made by a person'>artifact</b>, which will set me apart from the <b title='an insulting word for ordinary people'>hoi polloi</b> of comic book <b title='all the fans'>fandom</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's a great idea, I'm gonna get him to sign a Batman as well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is it about the word unique you don't understand?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, obviously you don't remember your <b title='circumcise - cut off the skin at the end of the penis'>circumcision</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's <b title='an antibiotic product [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neosporin">Wiki</a>]'>Neosporin</b> and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hi!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey. Guess who's gonna be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, can you give me a hint?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stan Lee.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, Stanley, Stanley, <b title='an American actor, writer, film producer and film director [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Tucci">Wiki</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Age_of_Extinction  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Age_of_Extinction%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Age_of_Extinction">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>]'>Stanley Tucci</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, Stan Lee.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You have no idea who he is, do you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course I do. You're an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good, good, so, who's Stan Lee?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, he was on Star Trek.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nope.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Star Wars?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those <b title='stupid, silly'>goofy</b> kung fu movies you love so much?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee">Wiki</a>]'>Bruce Lee</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother Stan?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don't you put it in the bank?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the <b title='rush/attack'>charge</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Undoubtedly yet another <b title='criticizing sb/sth in an unkind and indirect way'>snide</b> response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It bothers me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, this is a <b title='an official order to appear in a court of law'>summons</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A summons for what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture. (Imitates him)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>November 16? Penny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it isn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, it is.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it isn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, I have an <b title='of, relating to, or marked by extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images'>eidetic</b> memory. Also, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mmm, no, it isn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me? (Raj plays a tune)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn't driving and they were all, if it wasn't you, who was it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So you betrayed me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No! It wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands">Wiki</a>]'>Cayman Islands</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not going to pay a fine. That would imply I'm guilty.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You are guilty. (Raj's shirt plays the <b title='a small wooden hammer that sb in authority knocks on a table to emphasize a decision'>gavel</b> sound from <b title='an American police procedural and legal drama television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order">Wiki</a>]'>Law & Order</b>) That one I liked.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am not guilty. I only have a learner's permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a <b title='role, character'>part</b> in a movie or my own TV series.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defence right now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, he's going to jail.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now you see what you've done? Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa! What do you mean all?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, you're my friends. You'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal <b title='precedent - earlier decision, case, event, etc that is regarded as an example or rule for what comes later'>precedents</b>, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, okay. No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's what I'm saying.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice it would've been a much shorter movie. No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raj? You'll be there, won't you? (Shirt plays "incorrect" quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have <b title='forsake - abandon, give up, renounce'>forsaken</b> me. So, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, <b title='exclamation of disappointment'>balls</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please try to wear something appropriate. It won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
<s>Penny's door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Opening door) Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's just wrong.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I'd like to <b title='point out a flaw, misdeed, or mistake'>call on</b> your skills as an actress.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've <b title='take the liberty of doing sth - do sth without permission'>taken the liberty of</b> <b title='script - write the words'>scripting</b> your appearance on the witness stand because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a <b title='sb who behaves in an uncontrolled or unexpected way and is likely to cause problems for other people'>loose cannon</b>. Now, don't worry, it's written in your <b title='a form of a language that ordinary people use'>vernacular</b>. So shall we rehearse?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do I have a choice?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Reading)><b title='exclamation of agreement'>Darn tootin'</b>, I do, if the court will excuse my <b title='simple and ordinary ↗home, spin'>homespun</b>, corn-fed Nebraskan <b title='a way of saying sth'>turn of phrase</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent. Go on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And who performed that heroic act?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.<br>
<i>Penny</i>But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Only a suggestion. <b title='a short pause that you make when you are speaking because you feel upset or are beginning to cry'>A catch in your throat</b> would work just as well.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Pretending to be close to tears) But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
<s>The courtroom.</s>
<i>Judge</i>(To a guy) Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good morning, Your Honor. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.<br>
<i>Judge</i>I know what it means. I went to law school.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And yet you <b title='↗end up'>wound up</b> in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I'd like to begin with an opening statement.<br>
<i>Judge</i>The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a <b title='slightly dangerous and uncertain ↗risky, dice'>dicey</b>-looking breakfast <b title='a type of Mexican food [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito">Wiki</a>]'>burrito</b> this morning and just took an <b title='a drug used against diarrhea [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loperamide">Wiki</a>]'>Imodium</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a <b title='milk - draw milk from a cow etc'>milking</b> stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the <b title='sociopath - sb whose behavior towards other people is considered unacceptable, strange, and possibly dangerous'>sociopathic</b>. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of <b title='what is necessary is lawful [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_%28Q%29">Wiki</a>]'>quod est necessarium est licitum</b>, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a <b title='part of the Bill of Rights, which sets out rights of the accused in a criminal prosecution [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment">Wiki</a>]'>Sixth Amendment issue</b>. I'm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, <b title='namely'>to wit</b>, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.<br>
<i>Judge</i>Impressive.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Judge</i>Guilty. Pay the cashier.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I object. You're completely ignoring the law.<br>
<i>Judge</i>No, I'm following the law. I'm ignoring you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you <b title='be head or director of'>preside over</b> the kiddy table of yours.<br>
<i>Judge</i>Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I'm gonna give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
<s>A police cell. Three people sit on a bench inside. Sheldon points at the one on the end.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's my spot.
<s>A queue outside the comic book store.</s>
<i>Raj</i>I can't wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, come on, why would you do that?<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='The Hulk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_%28comics%29#Bruce_Banner">Wiki</a>]'>Bruce Banner</b>, <b title='Mister Fantastic [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Fantastic">Wiki</a>]'>Reed Richards</b>, <b title='Invisible Woman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Woman">Wiki</a>]'>Sue Storm</b>, <b title='Doctor Strange [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange">Wiki</a>]'>Stephen Strange</b>, <b title='Doctor Octopus [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Octopus">Wiki</a>]'>Otto Octavius</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer">Wiki</a>]'>Silver Surfer</b>, <b title='Spider-Man [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Wiki</a>]'>Peter Parker</b>, oh, and worst of all, <b title='a supporting character (and sometimes an antagonist) of Spider-Man [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Jonah_Jameson">Wiki</a>]'>J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.</b><br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I'm cutting. (Goes in front of Raj) I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you <b title='cheese off - make sb make sb annoyed, bored or frustrated '>cheese him off</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(On phone) Hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon's in jail.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon's in jail?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You <b title='call - predict sth before it happens, and then be credited for it'>called</b> it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So tell him to apologize.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn't <b title="come in sb's mind">occur to</b> me. If he doesn't apologize by 5 o'clock he is gonna spend the night in jail.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, that's terrible. Ooh, the line's moving. Gotta go. Bye. (Hangs up)
<s>The police cell.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me? Excuse me, <b title='sb whose responsibility is keeping a jail =jailer'>jailor</b>?<br>
<i>Guard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I need to use the restroom.<br>
<i>Guard</i><b title='go for it'>Knock yourself out</b>. (Points to urinal in cell)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's the toilet?<br>
<i>Guard</i>Well, it <b title="am/is/are/has/have not">ain't</b> a wishing well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, <b title='ever upward [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excelsior">Wiki</a>]'>Excelsior</b>!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, I didn't even mention <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum_Dum_Dugan">Wiki</a>]'>Dum Dum Dugan</b> or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Goblin">Wiki</a>]'>Green Goblin</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>Matt Murdock</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_Potts">Wiki</a>]'>Pepper Potts</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom">Wiki</a>]'>Victor Von Doom</b>, oh, and worst of all, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millie_the_Model">Wiki</a>]'>Millie the Model</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We're home.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know very well how it went.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was found guilty and fined $533.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm gonna write you a check for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I also now have three points on a driver's licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, that's enough, Howard. The poor guy's had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for <b title='the Italian word for ice cream [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelato">Wiki</a>]'>gelato</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You had gelato with Stan Lee?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He said we could call him Stan.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Except for Raj.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I realize that-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. <b title='a portion of Verse 51 from the 11th century work, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moving_Finger_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>] writ - formal legal written order'>The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!</b><br>

<i>Stuart</i>Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Nothing. I'm just getting ready to close up and head out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, nice.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn't even show up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favor.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Sure, yeah, name it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really wanna make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have his phone number.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Great!<br>
<i>Stuart</i>But I can't give it to you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then why did you tell me you had it?<br>

<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Mm-hmm. Wait.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Maybe we can make a deal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What kind of deal?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>I will give you the address if you go to my cousin's wedding with me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're <b title='extort - make sb give you sth by threatening them ↗blackmail'>extorting</b> a date out of me?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>I kind of have to. The cousin who's getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Can I bring Leonard?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Sure. What the hell.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Deal.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>We'll tell people he's your cousin.

<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell. At Stan Lee's house. We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.<br>

<i>Stan Lee</i>Oh, damn.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We're not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.<br>
<i>Stan Lee</i>I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You said we were invited.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.<br>
<i>Stan Lee</i>You know, you fan boys are <b title='very bad or shocking, terrible'>unbelievable</b>. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don't you just come on in and watch the <b title='Los Angeles Lakers [<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers">Wiki</a>]'>Lakers</b> game with me?<br>
