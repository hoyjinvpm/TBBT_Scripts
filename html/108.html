<s>The living room. Sheldon is putting cards into his new wallet.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Damn you, walletnook.com!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, the online description was completely misleading. They said eight slots, plus removable id. To any rational person, that would mean room for nine cards, but they don't tell you, the removable id takes up one slot. It's a nightmare!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, now, do you really need the honorary <b title='a fictional superhero team that appears in comic books published by DC Comics. originally featured Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and the Martian Manhunter. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_league_of_america">Wiki</a>]'>Justice League of America</b> membership card?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It says "keep this <b title='if you have sth on/about your person, you have it in your pockets or attached to you'>on your person</b> at all times." (Someone knocks on the door; Leonard goes get it) it's right here under Batman's signature.<br>
(Raj and Howard enter. Raj is holding a laptop; he's webchatting with his parents.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>And this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Guess whose parents just got broadband.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi, Dr. And Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Tilt up the camera up! I'm looking at his crotch.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry, papa.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Oh, that's much better. Hi!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Raj</i>And over here is Sheldon. Hi! (Sheldon waves his hand) He lives with Leonard.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Oh, that's nice. Like <b title='A gay couple who Raj&#039;s parents know in India. [<a href="http://wiki.the-big-bang-theory.com/index.php/Haroon_and_Tanvir">Wiki</a>]'>Haroon and Tanvir</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, no. Not like Haroon and Tanvir.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Such sweet young men. <b title='Haroon and Tanvir'>They</b> just adopted the cutest little <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_people">Wiki</a>]'>Punjabi</b> baby.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. No, we're not like Haroon and Tanvir.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>So, are you boys <b title='academic - a teacher in a college or university'>academics</b> like our son?<br>
<i>Leonard and Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not at all.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Papa, please. Don't start.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>It was just a question. (To Raj's mother) He's so sensitive.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, that's my life. That's my friends. Good to see you. Say goodbye.<br>
<i>Leonard and Sheldon</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Wait! Wait! Before you go, we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends.<br>
(Raj walks to a couch, sits down, and puts the laptop on the coffee table).<br>
<i>Raj</i>What is it, papa?<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>friends.<br>
(They round)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Is it just me, or does web chatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless?<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?<br>
<i>Raj</i>The little fat girl that used to kick me in the <b title='the groin [<a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Lalita_Gupta">Lalita Gupta</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa">Wiki</a>]'>samosas</b> and call me <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchable_%28social_system%29">Wiki</a>]'>untouchable</b>?<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Yes. Well, now she's a dental student at <b title='University of South Carolina/Southern California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC">Wiki</a>]'>USC</b>, so we gave her your contact information.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why did you do that?<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>You're 26 years old, Rajesh. We want grandchildren.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But, papa, I'm not supposed...<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Lalita's parents approved the match.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid <b title='the big seasonal winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon">Wiki</a>]'>monsoon</b> season.<br>
<i>Raj</i>A spring wedding?<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>It's up to you, dear. We don't want to <b title='interfere'>meddle</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling. While arranged marriages are no longer the <b title='the usual/normal situation'>norm</b>, Indian parents continue to have a greater-than-average involvement in their children's love lives.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why are you telling me about my own culture?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You seemed confused.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry, mommy, papa, but with all due respect, I really don't want to...<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>I'm sorry, darling. We have to go. <b title='an American television comedy-drama starring Neil Patrick Harris as a teenage physician who also faces the problems of being a normal teenager [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doogie_Howser">Wiki</a>]'>Doogie Howser</b> is on. Grandma! It's Doogie time! Byebye!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Byebye!<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Closes the laptop) I don't believe it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programs in India.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It might <b title='give information about'>speak to</b> a cultural <b title='desire to achieve sth'>aspiration</b> to have one's children enter the medical profession.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I bet you're right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I bet they love <b title='scrubs - the special clothes worn by doctors and nurses when they do a medical operation. Scrubs - an American television program [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubs_(TV_series)">Wiki</a>]'>Scrubs</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title="Why shouldn't they love (Scrubs)?">What's not to love?</b><br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me! Hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger. What am I going to do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I suggest you <b title='do sth you have planned or agreed to do, esp after not being sure you want to do'>go through with</b> it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the 19th century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's the entire <b title='a statement or idea that you accept as true and use as a base for developing other ideas'>premise</b> of <b title='a musical. The story centers on Tevye, the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his family and Jewish religious traditions while outside influences encroach upon their lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters—each one&#039;s choice of husband moves further away from the customs of his faith—and with the edict of the Tsar that evicts the Jews from their village...[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddler_on_the_roof">Wiki</a>]'>Fiddler on the Roof</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which <b title='beyond'>transcends</b> <b title='the fact of belonging to a particular race'>ethnicity</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let's not forget it's got some really <b title='easy to remember'>catchy</b> tunes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Absolutely.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh yeah! Of course.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, I know what I'm gonna do.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Find new friends. (Storms off)<br>
<i>Howard</i>So who wants to rent Fiddler?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No need, we have the special edition.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On phone) This is dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the <b title='a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy and the night sky, or for training in celestial navigation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium">Wiki</a>]'>planetarium</b>. Well, I'm sorry, too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet. I understand, but it was between you and the museum of natural history, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. I'll miss you, too. Bye-bye. (To Leonard and Howard) Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Enters) Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly <b title='screw up - make sb feel very unhappy, confused, or upset'>screwed</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I've got some <b title='A feeler is long slender part in certain animals, esp insects. If you put out feelers, you make careful, quiet contacts with people.'>feelers</b> out. In the meantime, listen to this. "Hi, Rajesh. This is Lalita Gupta. Uh, your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So, I'm calling you and, uh, call me back. Bye." Can you believe how pushy she is?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So don't call her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So call her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>How can I call her? You know I can't talk to women.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm done. Anybody else?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Give me the phone.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Just give it to me. (Dials)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't worry. You'll thank me. (On phone, in an Indian accent) Hello, Lalita? Raj Koothrappali here. Yes, it is good to talk to you, too. So what are you wearing? Oh, not important. Uh, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet? Friday works for me! And I'll call you with a time and place. But in the meantime, <b title='stay cool'>keep it real</b>, babe. (Hangs up; to Raj) You may now thank me. (Tosses Raj the phone)<br>
<i>Raj</i>For what? Making me sound like a <b title='an American adult animated sitcom [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons">Wiki</a>]'>Simpsons</b> character?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. Next time make your own date.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I didn't want to make this one!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It worked for my parents.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hi, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I need some <b title='person or animal used in medical or other experiments'>guinea pigs</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in <b title='a suburb in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseda,_Los_Angeles">Wiki</a>]'>Reseda</b> you could try. But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest white mice instead? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I swear to god, Sheldon, one day, I'm going to <b title='learn how to operate or do sth'>get the hang of</b> talking to you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift, so I need to practice mixing drinks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, great. Well, the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, Leonard, how about it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. Besides, he doesn't drink, so... (Raj whispers something in his ear) Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, <b title='here you are'>here you go</b>, Leonard. One <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila_Sunrise_%28cocktail%29">Wiki</a>]'>Tequila Sunrise</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Raj, what'll it be? (Raj whispers something in Leonard's ear)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whatever you recommend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, how about a <b title='a sweet, mint-flavored, after-dinner drink [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_%28cocktail%29">Wiki</a>]'>Grasshopper</b>? I make a <b title='very good, excellent'>mean</b> Grasshopper. (Raj nods his agreement)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay? Good. <b title='come up - occur, arise'>Coming up</b>. Sheldon, what are you gonna have?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll have a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_coke">Wiki</a>]'>Diet Coke</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. I'll have a <b title='without alcohol'>virgin</b> <b title='made of cola, lime, and white rum [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba_libre">Wiki</a>]'>Cuba Libre</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So...coke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. And would you make it diet?<br>
<i>Penny</i>There's a can in the fridge.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A Cuba Libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then swim to Cuba.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Raj, here you go. All right. Who's next?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'd like to try a <b title='a layered cocktail [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_nipple">Wiki</a>]'>Slippery Nipple</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you're <b title='stop the supply of sth to sb'>cut off</b>. Anybody need a refill?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Where did my life go, Penny? (Penny is stunned) One day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee_Wee#Sports_and_games">Wiki</a>]'>Pee Wee cricket</b> matches in suburban New Delhi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are, are you talking to me?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi">Wiki</a>]'>Indira Gandhi</b> of <b title='a branch of particle physics that studies elementary particles of astronomical origin and their relation to astrophysics and cosmology [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_astrophysics">Wiki</a>]'>particle astrophysics</b>. But with a penis, of course.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's amazing.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ever since I was a little boy, my father wanted me to be a <b title='↗ob/gyn'>gynecologist</b> like him. How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the eye! You know what? I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer. It's time for a <b title='a big argument or conflict which is intended to settle a dispute that has lasted for a long time'>showdown</b>. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, sweetie, I think that's the Grasshopper talking.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, calm down. Look, no one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and see what happens?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Haven't you been listening to me? I cannot talk to women.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, Raj...<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no, let's see how long it takes him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women, but you've been talking to me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And now we'll never know.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're right. I... I am talking to you. Hello, Penny, how are you? (They shake hands violently)<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm fine.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the Grasshopper. It's a sweet, green miracle.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, if you're gonna drink on this date, just promise me you won't overdo it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything's going to be all <b title='hunky-dory = OK'>hunky-dunky</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that. Why don't you bring her to my restaurant while I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait a minute. What's the plan here? Let's say he meets her, he likes her, they get married. What's he gonna do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Worked for my parents.
<s>Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Raj</i>I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Well, you are.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Little Lalita. That's kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita. You should try it.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Oh, it's okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Yes, I do.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Well, I've been trying.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So you're a dental student. Mm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but, then, there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers, you're still winning.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Yay, me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(At the bar; to Penny) Do you have a drink that will make him less <b title='very offensive, unpleasant, or rude'>obnoxious</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Drinks do not work that way.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her. The last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a <b title='vestigal - remaining after almost all of sth has disappeared [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigial_tail#Human_tails">Wiki</a>] ↗appendix'>vestigial tail</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry I'm late.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come. (To Penny) Virgin Diet Cuba Libre, please.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In a tall glass with a lime wedge.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, how's Koothrappali... Oh, my lord.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's <b title='[<a href="http://wiki.the-big-bang-theory.com/wiki/Panchali,_Princess">Wiki</a>]'>Princess Panchali</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, Princess Panchali, from The Monkey and the Princess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah. I tried to watch that online, but they wanted my credit card.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a children's story.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, no, it isn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who <b title='behave in a friendly way towards'>befriends</b> a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I <b title="feel that you understand sb's problem, situation etc">related to</b> it quite strongly.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know the reason.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Panchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Every year at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic-con">Wiki</a>] ↗conference'>Comic-Con</b>. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire Snow White to come to your house. Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta. Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Forgive me, your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You are the living <b title='sb/sth that represents a quality or an idea exactly'>embodiment</b> of the beautiful Princess Panchali.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Oh, no kidding. Who... who is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A beloved character from an Indian folktale.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Oh. Us Indian or <b title='Native American gaming refers to casinos, bingo halls, and other gambling operations on Indian reservations or other tribal land in the United States. Because these areas have tribal sovereignty, states have limited ability to forbid gambling there. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_gaming">Wiki</a>]'>"come to our casino" Indian</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You indian.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The resemblance is remarkable. I can <b title='almost'>practically</b> smell the lotus blossoms woven into your <b title='a hard black wood / black'>ebony</b> hair.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Well, thanks. I imagine you smell very nice, too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Really? So do I.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Bu-but you're a dentist. He's <b title='crazy'>nuts</b>.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Don't be insulting, Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was said that the gods <b title='fashion - shape/make'>fashioned</b> her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Oh, my.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Back off, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>If you do not stop hitting on my lady, you will feel the full extent of my wrath.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not hitting on her.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>And I am not your lady.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And you have no wrath.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are <b title='used to say that a situation is not exactly as you describe it, but the effect is the same as if it were'>for all intents and purposes</b> 100% hooked up.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Okay, let's <b title='understand the facts of a situation and be able to tell them correctly'>get something straight</b> here. The only reason I came tonight was to <b title='make my parents stop criticizing me or complaining about me'>get my parents off my case</b>. I certainly don't need to be getting this <b title='belonging to or typical of a period in the past'>old-world</b> crap from you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='Fuck'>Screw</b> Princess Panchali.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Hey, you can't talk to me like that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But you're not Princess Panchali.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Luckily for you; she could have you <b title="behead - cut off sb's head as a punishment">beheaded</b>.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Sheldon, are you hungry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I could eat.<br>
<i>Lalita</i>Let's go. (Pulls him away)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What just happened?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='completely defeat sb'>Beats the hell out of</b> me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll tell you what happened. I just learned how to pick up Indian <b title='young women'>chicks</b>.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents?<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>kI play golf with her father. I won't be able to look at him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, papa.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Oh, now you're a funny man? This is not funny, Mr. Funny man.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, <b title='considering everything that has an effect on the situation'>in all fairness</b>, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>This is a family matter, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I'm Leonard.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Oh, sorry. You all look alike to us.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But he's right, papa. Listen to him. (Sheldon enters; to Sheldon) You! You are the one who ruined everything.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Who is it? We can't see.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Turn us. Turn us.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How would I know? Do you have a low sperm count?<br>
<i>Raj</i>This has nothing to do with my sperm count.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>You are wearing the <b title='↗briefs'>boxers</b> that we sent you, aren't you, Rajesh?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes, mommy.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear <b title='More recently, "tighty-whiteys" has become a commonly used nickname for briefs. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tighty-whities">Wiki</a>]'>tighty-whiteys</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What did I do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. All right, noted. Sorry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Take it, Raj. It's more than I've ever gotten.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And may I point out, she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Drunk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And boring, her words.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>I knew it. He moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm-I'm not an alcoholic.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Then why were you drunk?<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We ate, she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks - nothing I didn't already know, and I came home.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So you're not gonna see her again?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren?
