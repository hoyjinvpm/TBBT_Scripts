<i>Leonard</i>It's from <b title='an American fantasy drama television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones">Wiki</a>]'>Game of Thrones</b>. What do you think?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know. If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I've long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did you have in mind?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with <b title='Excalibur or Caliburn is the legendary sword of King Arthur [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur">Wiki</a>]'>Excalibur</b>. It gives you the right to rule England.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It would be a replica of a movie <b title='a small object used by actors during the performance of a play or in a film/movie'>prop</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='to show that you understand why sb has done or said sth'>Fair enough</b>. It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so, what do you wanna do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese <b title='a place where people work for low wages in poor conditions'>sweatshop</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins">Wiki</a>]'>Bilbo Baggins</b>' sword over there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly? Okay, let's go for it.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. It's okay, I guess.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay? It's magnificent.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, it's hard to put a price on something that's a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let's say 250?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, that's pretty steep.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on. Can you do any better?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Are you kidding? I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, did you hear that? We're getting the friends and family discount. We are honored and we will take it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Slow down. Two hundred.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Will you shut up?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Tell you what, I'll go two thirty-five.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nope. Maybe another time.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Take it, take it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Two hundred.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Man, you're killing me!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Killing you? I can't breathe.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Two ten, and I'm losing money.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Two ten and you throw in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">Wiki</a>]'>Iron Man</b> helmet.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Are you crazy? That helmet's signed by <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Jr.">Wiki</a>]'>Robert Downey Jr.</b><br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay, if you're gonna question the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Thank you. I can eat meat this week.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See that? I just saved us forty bucks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>You want me to wrap it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's okay. I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.<br>
<i>Wil Wheaton</i>(Entering) Hey, Stuart.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Ah, hey, Wil.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello, Wil Wheaton. (Wiedling the sword)<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?<br>
<i>Wil</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not surprised.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Here's the Batman 612 with the <b title='a Korean American comic book artist, writer, editor and publisher [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lee">Wiki</a>]'>Jim Lee</b> alternate cover that you wanted.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Awesome. What do I owe you?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Forty bucks.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Good deal.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='sb who is easily deceived'>Sucker</b>. Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Will there be girls there?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Yeah, of course.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>'Cause there wasn't last time.<br>
<i>Wil</i>There will be girls. You guys are invited if you wanna come by.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Wil</i>All right, great. <b title='see you later'>Later</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see what you're doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my <b title='If two people or two groups of people are sworn enemies, they dislike each other very much ↗mortal enemy/foe'>sworn enemy</b>, he tells everyone we're going to be there, and when we don't show, he looks the fool. <b title='very, extremely'>Fiendishly</b> clever.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was actually thinking about going.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, great, more guys. It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton <b title='a party of only guys (or at least 80% guys), where there is a substantial abundance of weiner (penis)'>sausage fest</b>.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, can you grab me a water?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Possibly.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can you or can't you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not that simple, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It never is, is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I'm characterizing this phenomenon as <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Wiki</a>]'>Schrodinger's Friendship</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it. Can I have my water?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, what is going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment-<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, no, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother's camp <b title='a very large box made of wood or metal, in which clothes, books etc are stored or packed for travel'>trunk</b>, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='simple and ordinary'>Homespun</b> stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that <b title='defy - be unaffected by'>defies</b> it. You're the whole package, aren't you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Arriving) Sorry I'm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team's design for the <b title='↗outer space'>deep field space</b> telescope that's going on the International Space Station this spring.<br>
<i>All</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!<br>
<i>Howard</i>It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mohammed Lee.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Who's Mohammed Lee?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn't know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical <b title='advantage'>edge</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's me, Sheldon. It's me. I'm going up in space! Technically, I'm an astronaut.<br>
<i>All</i>Wow, that's amazing!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hang on a second. NASA doesn't have a shuttle any more. How are you gonna get up there?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, well, it's really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian <b title='an abbreviation for the "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"'>Soyuz</b> rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Are those Russian rockets safe?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident">Three Mile Island accident</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</a>]'>Chernobyl</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard's making that a reality. We're all very proud of you.<br>
<i>All</i>Cheers.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That was a lovely toast. <b title='congratulations or praise'>Kudos</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Simultaneously, a festival of <b title='cloy - make you feel sick or annoyed by being too sweet or too pleasant'>cloying</b> <b title='cliché - a phrase or idea that is boring because people use it a lot and it is no longer original'>clichés</b>. You sicken me.
<s>Bernadette's car.</s>
<i>Howard</i>You're really quiet. Is everything okay?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Fine. Just a little tired.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my <b title='general meaning or sense; gist'>drift</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I always catch your drift.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, well, something's obviously bugging you. What is it?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I just can't believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I get it. You're worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there's a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Just stop talking, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>This isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What did you think was gonna happen?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Honestly? sex.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honor it is to be chosen to go into space?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to be a team.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sorry. You're right. Okay, let's try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, we're a team. So, what do you think?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well why not?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was gonna come home alive. It was horrible. And I don't wanna live that way with you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, <b title="a word used in comic books or children's stories to show that sb is crying">boo-hoo</b>, you're not going to space!
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Pretty cool about Howard, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you prefer a simpler application of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg">Wiki</a>]'>Heisenberg</b>'s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You never stop talking, do you?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Mortal enemy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm-hmm.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a <b title='The monkey wrench (US) or gas grips (UK) is an adjustable wrench. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_wrench">Wiki</a>] -or- monkey wrench - fool, gullible (too ready to believe what other people tell you) person'>left-handed monkey wrench</b>, but, you really have a mortal enemy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This'll just take a moment. It's on a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">Wiki</a>]'>five and a quarter inch floppy</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>A floppy disk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I started the list when I was nine.<br>
<i>Amy</i>How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?<br>
<i>All</i>Oh! Oh, God!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher <b title='a toy model of a person or imaginary being'>action figure</b> signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on <b title='an American panel game show, in which two contestants play tic-tac-toe to win cash and prizes.

Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the <b title='a Japanese company that markets storage media and flash memory'>Verbatim Corporation</b> in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Change your mind about sex? I'm still mad, but I'll do it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, I've just been thinking. It doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety. I don't wanna be the person who stands between you and your dreams.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I love you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I love you, too. So, sex now?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I'll be right back. (Exits) (Howard puts on some music)<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>(Comes back) I'm ready.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?<br>
<i>Howard</i>What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow. You're not only our first astronaut. You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You're like a rock star.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Little bit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it's doing right. Excuse me, <b title='fictional soldiers from the Star Wars universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_%28Star_Wars%29">Wiki</a>]'>Stormtrooper</b>. These are the <b title='Droids are robotic machines, as found in Star Wars films, books and television series'>droids</b> you're looking for.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm going to a party. I'm not <b title='↗turn sb in - hand sb over to the police to be arrested'>turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to</b> the empire!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not yet.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, what's gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know. If we're gonna get back together, she's gonna have to apologize and accept that I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Then she's gonna have to convince your mother to let you go into space.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Obviously.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can't go to space. He's like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?<br>
<i>Amy</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I was there that day. Sheldon <b title='Hurt his back. Throwing your back out could be pulling a muscle due to strenuous activity.'>threw his back out</b> handing him that book.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't wanna break up over this.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?<br>
<i>Amy</i>It's not for us to judge. We're just here to provide comfort and support while you <b title='begin to understand and deal with sth difficult'>come to grips with</b> what a <b title='extremely bad, immoral, or cruel'>despicable</b> thing you've done.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I do, with all my heart.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Got it. Just had to check.<br>
<i>Amy</i>He's great.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, Sheldon, we're going to Wil's. This is your last chance.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from <b title='a 1986 American coming of age drama comedy film... Wil Wheaton as Gordie Lachance (aged 12) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_by_Me_%28film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Stand By Me</b> that no one remembers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You want to drive?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I just got a text from Stuart. <b title='an American actor, best known for his portrayal of the android Lieutenant Commander Data in the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation and four subsequent films [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Spiner">Wiki</a>]'>Brent Spiner</b> is at the party.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Brent Spiner?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't care.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did, but I think I've kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, <b title='A stock character is a stereotypical person whom audiences readily recognize from frequent recurrences in a particular literary tradition.

<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Howard, Bernadette's here!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Tell her I'm not home!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>What kind of a <b title='a stupid person'>schmuck</b> play is that? She can hear you shouting!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Can we talk?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You can. I have nothing to say.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>All right. I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry I said something to your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I know. I'm sorry. I got scared.<br>
<i>Howard</i>If you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy <b title='sb who likes doing dangerous things'>daredevil</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I know.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it, 'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I wannat go to the Moon, I wanna go to Mars. I wanna take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Really? You got seasick on <b title='a Disney theme park attraction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(theme_park_ride)">Wiki</a>]'>Pirates of the Caribbean</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, those <b title='It is used to describe a child who is growing, or a person who is heavy, with a lot of fat or muscle on their body.'>big</b> kids were rocking it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I just met her gynaecologist!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you're still my little buddy. I'm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let's meet Brent Spiner and go home.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hey, Sheldon, I'm so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What I'd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.<br>
<i>Wil</i>This is for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>An original <b title='↗brand-new'>mint</b>-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.<br>
<i>Wil</i>I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn't show up.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Look at what I wrote.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Wil</i>It's my last one. I want you to have it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend! (HUGS HIM)<br>
<i>Brent Spiner</i>Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure, signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Brent</i>Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You've already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Don't worry. It doesn't take up a whole lot of your time.<br>
