<i>Sheldon</i>This movie <b title='baffle - confuse sb completely'>baffles</b> me every time we watch it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The instructions are very clear: "Don't feed the <b title='gremlin - an imaginary evil spirit that is blamed for problems in machinery'>gremlins</b> after midnight." "Don't get the gremlins wet." How hard is that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi,guys. Hi,honey.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ooh,we're "honey" now,are we?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Since their relationship became <b title="relating to sex or sb's body ↗physical">carnal</b>, Penny has upgraded his <b title='marked or separated'>designated</b> term of <b title='a word or an expression that is used to show affection'>endearment</b>, thus distinguishing him from those she calls "sweetie," usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're boring people, sweetie.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what are you guys doing?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Celebrating <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day">Wiki</a>]'>Columbus Day</b>.

<i>Penny</i>Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The parade.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh,you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for Thanksgiving, but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's he on trial for?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you'd actually like my brother. He's kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I'd have Thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll be there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I guess I could serve both.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You guess? You don't seem to <b title='have a handle on sb/sth - understand or know about sb/sth'>have much of a handle on</b> this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year, my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Tur-briska-fil?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Turkey stuffed with a <b title='a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket">Wiki</a>]'>brisket</b> stuffed with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefilte_fish">Wiki</a>]'>gefilte fish</b>. It's not as good as it sounds.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Raj, what about you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj cries and runs away) All right, this year, you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don't even chew it. I swallow it like pills.
<s>Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So,what's going on with Raj?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-briska-fil.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hard to believe, but go on.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The bad news is, he says he's getting <b title='deport - force sb to leave a country ↗banish, expel, export, import'>deported</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you mean, he's getting deported?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe it means that the U.S.government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him, or wander the <b title='the areas of sea that are not under the legal control of any one country'>high seas</b> as a stateless pirate. Personally, I'd choose pirate.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that's an all-male profession.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Raj who's in the bathroom) Okay, she's gone.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry. I lost my cool.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what's going on?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, <b title='Here is the matter/problem/task'>here's the deal</b>: Six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of <b title='minor planets in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance than Neptune. trans- across/beyond [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object">Wiki</a>]'>trans-Neptunian objects</b> ran into a <b title='a situation from which no more progress is possible'>dead end</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So?<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, my visa's only good as long as I'm employed at the university. When they find out I've got <b title='nothing'>squat</b>, they're going to cut me off. By the way,when I say squat, I mean <b title='nothing'>diddly</b>-squat. I wish I had squat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, wait,what have you been doing for the past six months?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, checking e-mail, updating my Facebook status, <b title='mess up - spoil, ruin, make sth dirty or untidy'>messing up</b> Wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Wiki</a>]'>Netflix</b> lets you stream movies on your computer now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you've continued to take the university's money <b title='without telling the truth about yourself or your intentions'>under false pretenses</b>? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Well <b title='almost, virtually'>practically</b> <b title='must be done =compulsory, obligatory'>mandatory</b> for a pirate.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't want to go back to India. It's hot and loud, and there's so many people. You have no idea, they're everywhere.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, guys, think. How do we keep Raj in the country?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(From the hall) Why doesn't he just get another job?<br>
(Raj whispers something in Howard's ear)<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you asking me for? I don't know if you can talk now or not.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, beef, I'm gonna miss you so much. Do you know, at the <b title='also known as Bombay [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Wiki</a>]'>Mumbai</b> McDonald's, you can't get a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac">Wiki</a>]'>Big Mac</b>? All you can get is a Chicken <b title='great/high king [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja">Wiki</a>]'>Maharaja</b> Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India, believe you me, is really not that special.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't worry, you'll find another job.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, let me start practicing for it. "Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?"<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hello, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Forgive me, as you know, I'm not <b title='skilful'>adept</b> at reading facial cues, but I'm going to take a <b title='attempt'>stab</b> here: You're either sad or <b title='nauseate - make sb feel that they are going to throw up'>nauseated</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm sad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was going to say sad. I don't know why I <b title='hedge - avoid giving a direct answer to a question'>hedged</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you eating?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='curved macaroni [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni">Wiki</a>]'>Elbow macaroni</b> with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, Beefaroni. I think I'll miss you most of all.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've always been a little confused about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We believe cows are gods.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not <b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>technically</b>. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like god.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out, I swear to cow!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Me too. I'm just- I'm a little <b title='nervous, excited, irritable'>on edge</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears <b title='not hopeful or encouraging, dismal, gloomy'>bleak</b> at best.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're wrong about Hinduism and cows.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the <b title='relating to the stars'>stellar</b> evolution research team.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You-You're kidding! That's fantastic!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on. What are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm on it. (Dials)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's happy, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='if you nail sth, you succeed in getting it'>Nailed</b> it.
<s>Professor Laughlin's office.</s>
<i>Prof. Laughlin</i>Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested in joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, no, it's a very promising area. In a perfect world, I'd spend several more years on it. But, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.<br>
<i>Prof. Laughlin</i>Splendid. So, please sit down. Can I offer you a <b title='a pale or dark brown strong wine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry">Wiki</a>]'>sherry</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh, a little early, isn't it?<br>
<i>Prof. Laughlin</i>Not on <b title='a star [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri">Wiki</a>]'>Proxima Centauri</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's very good. <b title='very'>Jolly</b> amusing, but if you don't mind, I'll hold off until sunset on <b title='a moon of Saturn [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)">Wiki</a>]'>Titan</b>.<br>
<i>Prof. Laughlin</i>Well done. I have a feeling you're going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you, sir.<br>
[Someone knocks on the door and a woman enters.]<br>
<i>Woman</i>I'm sorry. Am I late?<br>
<i>Prof. Laughlin</i>No, no, no. Right on time. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She'll be heading up our data analysis team.<br>
<i>Dr. Millstone</i>It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. (He smiles) I read your paper on <b title='a region of the Solar System beyond the planets [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">Wiki</a>]'>Kuiper Belt</b> object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. (He smiles again and downs the glass of sherry) How did you correct for the <b title='a statistical bias in which there is an error in choosing the individuals or groups to take part in a scientific study [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">Wiki</a>]'>selection bias</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I ran a simulation allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.<br>
<i>Dr. Millstone</i>Uh, that's just fascinating.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. (Downs another glass) Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>What do you mean you didn't get the job? How could you not get it?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, he's British, I'm Indian. Ever since <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Wiki</a>]'>Gandhi</b>, they haven't liked us very much.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's okay. A complaint's been filed. So, that's it. That was my last hope. I'm gonna be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the <b title='humorous but rather critical, mocking'>sardonic</b> <b title='barb - hurtful remark'>barbs</b> of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T Customer Service.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm really gonna miss you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Will you come visit me in India?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Tell you what, we'll Skype.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Enters) Gentlemen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the <b title='in a less important position'>subordinate</b> male <b title='main character'>protagonist</b> in countless action movies who disappears halfway through the second <b title='a round object onto which film etc can be wound'>reel</b>, I have returned to save the day. Odd. Usually, he's met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">Wiki</a>]'>string theory</b> implications of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray">Wiki</a>]'>gamma rays</b> from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">Wiki</a>]'>dark matter</b> <b title='total destruction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation">Wiki</a>]'>annihilations</b>, and then it occurred to me that I could benefit-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, Sheldon. How many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, if you didn't cheer at my entrance, it's too late to <b title='accept'>buy into</b> the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and Raj can come work for me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You want me to work with you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For me. You're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the <b title='a trans-boundary river of Asia [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges">Wiki</a>]'>Ganges</b> with a <b title="A paper cut occurs when a piece of paper or other thin, sharp material slices a person's skin.">paper cut</b> on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a <b title='caused by a virus'>viral</b> infection than work with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For me.
<s>Sheldon's office. Raj knocks on the door and enters.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, are you busy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course I'm busy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Shall I wait?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, please. How may I help you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published materials. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm impressed, Raj. Those are very <b title='reasonable and correct'>cogent</b> and reasonable conditions.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I reject them all.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood. I'm not giving you the job. I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we'll get started with the interview.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wha... you're kidding!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Motions for Raj to sit down) Please.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, that's what you wear to an interview?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, dude, we've been friends for years.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='pull strings - use your influence to get an advantage'>pulling strings</b>, are we?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Buzzinga! You've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I'm your boss now. You may wanna laugh at that.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Ah, this is nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don't have to <b title='drive a car for sb as your job'>chauffeur</b> him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm-hmm. Hey, wanna get a little crazy?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you thinking?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot and make out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are a dirty girl.<br>
[Someone knocks on the door.]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God, how did he know?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Enters) Hello.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Am I interrupting?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Little bit, yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Guess I should've called.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, maybe.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Tonight's the night I usually go <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_dance">Wiki</a>]'>line dancing</b> with Raj at the Palomino.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But he's working with Sheldon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, we know.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Want me to leave?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, whatever.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So, what are we watching? <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City_%28film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Sex and the City</b>. <b title='used as an expression of surprise or slight fear'>Yikes</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, I happen to love this movie.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine, let's watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. (Sheldon whips around and stares at him) I was making a joke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm the boss. I make the jokes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry. Go ahead and make your joke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is not the time for joking. We're doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right, let's <b title='start sth in a determined way'>buckle down</b> and work. (Sheldon stares at the board; Raj falls alseep with his head on the desk; Shelon lies on the floor; time lapses) Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I need an aspirin.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Top desk drawer.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>That was fun. Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you every time we have sex.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, okay. Tomorrow you're gonna get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='a well-known traditional Irish greeting that Irish people don’t really use any more, "The best part of the morning to you" [<a href="http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/top-of-the-morning-to-yourself">link</a>]'>Top o' the mornin' to ya</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to <b title='swindle, cheat'>scam</b> on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">Wiki</a>]'>hippie</b> <b title='chick - young woman'>chicks</b> at the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_market">Wiki</a>]'>farmer's market</b>, but he's still working with Sheldon, so I thought I'd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It's the perfect meal for <b title='after sex, postcoital'>après l'amour</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, kill me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish. <b title='well done'>Bravo</b>, Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>See, if you had killed me when I said "kill me," I wouldn't have had to hear that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you guys think? Wanna <b title='go to see/visit'>take in</b> a <b title='a performance of a play or film in the afternoon'>matinee</b>, maybe go <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_skating">Wiki</a>]'>Rollerblading</b>, catch a <b title='step aerobics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_aerobics">Wiki</a>]'>step</b> class?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do something.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure. <b title="What's up">'Sup</b>, Holmes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, please understand that it's not that we don't want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some... alone time.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh. I-I get it, I'm the <b title='sb who deters the socialization of a couple'>third wheel</b>. Sorry, I should've seen that. I'll get out of your way. Uh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still l hot.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Howard, come back.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Raj</i>No no no no! That rate is much too low from what we'd expect from this collision. Do you understand we're talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I'm the astrophysicist. "Astro" means "space."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"<b title='of the stars or outer space'>Astro</b>" means "star."<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I'd be <b title="kick sb's ass/butt - defeat/punish sb">kicking your butt</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>English is your native language.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There is a <b title='narrow'>fine</b> line between wrong and <b title='sb who has the ability to think about or plan the future in an intelligent, imaginative way'>visionary</b>. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>My God, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Caca?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It means "<b title='solid waste from the body'>doo-doo</b>."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me-<br>
<i>Raj</i>Aha! So I am working with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In this context, "with me" means "for me."<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, well, in this context...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I'm wrong, prove it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay. Here's where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No no no. You've misstated the atomic weight of the target.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Let me finish.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're <b title='deface - spoil it sthby writing or drawing things on it'>defacing</b> my work.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Give me the eraser.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>said give it to me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come and get it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. (Erases Raj's writing with his hand) Oh, Lord. (Snatches some tissues) (Raj goes back to write on the board) Dr. Koothrappali, as your <b title='sb who has a higher rank or position'>superior</b>, I forbid you from writing on my board!<br>
<i>Raj</i>You are not my superior.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am in every way.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (Does a weird hand movement) Nice working with you. (Leaves and then comes back) I'm sorry, for you. (Leaves) (Shedon tries the hand movement Raj did and fails)
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Raj. Raj. Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Opens the door) I'm busy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Doing what? (Rajs does the hand movement again) All right, you've made your point.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you want, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So you were wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't say that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's the only logical <b title='conclusion'>inference</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nevertheless, I didn't say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>For you or with you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In this context, "for me" could mean "with me."<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right, but I have some conditions.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I reject them all.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll take the job. See you Monday.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, you have to drive me home.<br>
<i>Raj</i>How did you get here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I walked.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So walk home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't. There's a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 <b title='gigaelectronvolt,'>GEV</b> particles.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right.
