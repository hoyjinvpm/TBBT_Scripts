<s>The living room. Sheldon groans.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is Thai food.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='said when sth bad starts happening again'>Here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We don't have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this <b title='a situation that never changes, so that you feel bored'>rut</b> we've been in lately.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we're going to abandon that, why even call it Thursday? Let's call it "Quonko Day" and divide it into <b title='[<a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=2829556">link</a>]'>29 hours of 17 minutes apiece</b>, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god <b title='the ancient Egyptian solar deity [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra">Wiki</a>]'>Ra</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I could go for some goat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something different tonight.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Let's go to the comic book store.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We went to the comic book store last night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic-book night. Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday because it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to show approval'>Way to</b> <b title='think outside the box - think freely'>think outside but pressed right up against the box</b>, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are we gonna do tonight?<br>
<i>Howard</i>If I may <b title='offer'>proffer</b> a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies' Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better-looking <b title='because of'>courtesy of</b> 99-cent <b title='a cocktail [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita">Wiki</a>]'>margaritas</b> and <b title='buy one and get one free'>two-for-one</b> <b title='sold prepared (ready to eat) or in powder form [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jell-O">Wiki</a>]'>Jell-O</b> <b title='shot - a small amount of a drink'>shots</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, Howard, the odds of us <b title='↗hook up with'>picking up</b> girls in a bar are <b title='almost'>practically</b> zero.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh. Really? Are you familiar with the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Wiki</a>]'>Drake equation</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The one that estimates the odds of making contact with <b title='extraterrestrial - a creature that people think may exist on another planet ↗terra firma'>extraterrestrials</b> by calculating the product of increasing restricted series of fractional values such as stars with planets and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, that one. (Sheldon smirks) You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive and what I call The Wolowitz Coefficient.<br>
<i>Raj</i>The Wolowitz Coefficient?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='the fatter the needier'>Neediness times dress-size squared</b>. <b title='crunch (the) numbers - do a lot of calculations in order to find an answer'>Crunching my numbers</b>, I <b title='find/produce'>come up with</b> a <b title='↗approximate, ballpark'>conservative</b> 5812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're joking.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm a <b title='sexually excited'>horny</b> engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, what are we waiting for? Let's <b title='leave'>bounce</b>, bitches.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you're right. It's Anything Can Happen Thursday. Let's hit the clubs and meet hot women.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Here we go. Lock up your daughters. We're gonna <b title='have sex with a person and then stop seeing that person'>hit it and quit it</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Or, we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Also a good plan.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right. But next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we're definitely going to a bar.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, absolutely.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies? We're eventually coming for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fascinating.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys. Where're you heading?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To the comic book store. You're probably thinking, "But comic book store on a Thursday? Why, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice&#039;s Adventures in Wonderland</a>]'>I've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness.</b>" What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You got me. Oh, hey, while you're there, could you <b title='pick up - get'>pick me up</b> a few comics for my nephew's birthday?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I think you mean comic books. Comics are <b title='not very good or effective'>feeble</b> attempts at humor featuring talking babies and <b title='anthropomorphize - ascribe human characteristics to'>anthropomorphized</b> pets, found traditionally in the optimistically named "funny pages."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. What does he like?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know, he's thirteen, just pick out anything.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just pick out anything? Maybe the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career form without knowing his <b title='natural ability or skill ↗attitude, appetite'>aptitude</b>, pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements, or his feelings about little <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow">Wiki</a>]'>marshmallows</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, <b title='very impressive'>Spectacular</b> Spider-Man, The <b title='wonderful'>Marvelous</b> Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know this can go on all night. Why don't you just come with us?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ugh. That's what I was trying to avoid.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I forgot <b title='causing great surprise, excitement, or interest ↗dramatic'>Sensational</b> Spider-Man.
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, what a cute little store. Everybody's staring at me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't worry. They're more scared of you than you are of them.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Unlikely. Here. What about this one for my nephew?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A superb choice.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, provided he has already read <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Crisis">Wiki</a>]'>Infinite Crisis</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_%28comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>52</b> and is familiar with the reestablishment of the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">Wiki</a>]'>DC</b> <b title='multiple universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>Multiverse</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, what's a Multiverse?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Get her out of here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, I'll help you pick something.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's right. She's with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='used to say that you already know how bad sth is, esp because you have experienced it yourself'>Tell me about it</b>. Oh, look, a new Batman belt buckle.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She's just looking for some comic books.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, really? Wow. <b title='blink your eyes'>Blink</b> twice if you're here against your will.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think we're fine, Stuart.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay. Well, let me know if you need anything. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. Oh, he seems like a nice guy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You mean for someone who's <b title='be into sth - like sth'>into</b> comic books?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no no. I just meant for- Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Honey, just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdoes. Stuart's a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode lsland School of Design.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, what about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants. He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.<br>
<i>Sheldon & Howard</i>(Browsing combic books) Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it. Need it!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let it go, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why should I let it go? I saw it first.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, but I saw it from the front.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A far less impressive <b title='successful completion of sth needing skill, strength or courage'>feat</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, come on, I need this for my Batman collection.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I need it for my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_%28comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>Robin</b> collection.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I gamble? It's mine. Let go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You let go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. He won't let go of my comic book.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's my comic book.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, we need a ruling.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, cut it in half?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To Stuart) Excuse me.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, hello again.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>A 13-year-old girl? (Penny laughs) But if you're dead set on a comic book, try this.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer">Wiki</a>]'>Hellblazer</b>." What's this about?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>A morally ambiguous <b title='a man who persuades people to give him their money or property by lying to them'>confidence man</b> who smokes, has lung cancer and is <b title='torment - make sb suffer very much ↗torture'>tormented</b> by the spirits of the undead.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, if that doesn't make me the favorite aunt, I don't know what will. (Seeing a sketch) Is this me?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Depends. Do you like it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, it's really good.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Yes, that's you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's so sweet. But what if I didn't like it?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>It'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't believe it. Stuart's <b title='put the moves on - make sexual advances to'>putting the moves on</b> Penny.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I have got to learn how to draw. (Sheldon snatches the comic book) Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Once again, defeated by your own <b title='having or showing too much interest in sex'>prurient</b> interests.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Guys, have you seen Stuart all <b title='occupied, busy with'>up</b> in Penny's business over there?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nobody's up in anybody's business. Let's just buy our stuff and go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you've got my number. Now, give me the picture.<br>
bi All right. You <b title='be very firm when you are making an agreement ↗put your foot down'>drive a hard bargain</b>, but here. (Hands her the picture)<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. So, um, just give me a call.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
<s>The living room. Sheldon's checking his new-bought combic book.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look at that. That's a <b title='a hollow area in the surface of sth'>dent</b>. Thank you, Howard "Ham-Fisted" Wolowitz. (Leonard turns off the TV) Did you shut the TV off in the middle of the classic <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine">Wiki</a>]'>Deep Space Nine Star Trek</b>: The Original Series "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles">Wiki</a>]'>Trouble With Tribbles</b>" <b title='a change from one situation or style to another'>crossover</b> episode?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Apparently so.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you ill?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional <b title='a state of confusion, excitement, or anxiety ↗trauma'>turmoil</b> over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When did you <b title='notice and react to'>pick up on</b> that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A moment ago, you turned off the TV in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine Star Trek: The Original Series "Trouble With Tribbles" crossover episode. Would you like some advice?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Gee, thanks a lot.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you rather I offer my personal insight?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I don't need any insights. I just wanna know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me. We're practically the same guy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I disagree. You know, Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed, and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right. I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My original point.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Chinese food, <b title='old, but high quality'>vintage</b> video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Who's <b title='willing to take part in'>up for</b> Sheldon-Free Saturday?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys. Hey, Penny, and Stuart. Hey, Stuart.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, what are you kids up to?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And you guys are going together. Great.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>It is great. Really great. <b title='fucking'>Freaking</b> awesome. What are you doing?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Wiki</a>]'>Zork</b>. It's the buggy beta version.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>See you, guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>See you, Stuart.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Take me to a bar with women.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, if I get lucky, I don't wanna be caught in my <b title='a fictional character, a superhero appearing in comic book titles by DC Comics. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman">Wiki</a>]'>Aquaman</b> briefs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Raj) Do you? Let's go.
<s>A bar.</s>
<i>Raj</i>May I have a <b title='a sweet, mint-flavored, after-dinner drink [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_%28cocktail%29">Wiki</a>]'>grasshopper</b> with a little umbrella, please?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, he may not.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Fine. I'll have a chocolate <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martini_(cocktail)">Wiki</a>]'>martini</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wrong again.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, you know I can't talk to women unless I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of <b title='also known as the "festival of lights" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali">Wiki</a>]'>Diwali</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Gotcha. I'll have a <b title='a sweet, brandy-based cocktail [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy_Alexander">Wiki</a>]'>Brandy Alexander</b>. (Howard is frustrated)<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">Wiki</a>]'>the Three Musketeers</b> just became the <b title='Batman and Robin [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Duo">Wiki</a>]'>Dynamic Duo</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Should we talk to some of these women?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, it's way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the <b title='A jock is a young man who is enthusiastic about a particular sport and spends a lot of time playing it'>jocks</b> <b title='make sth thinner'>thin</b> the herd and then, we go after the weak and the old and the lame.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's your system?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's my system. Oh, and if you <b title='see, notice'>spot</b> a <b title='girl'>chick</b> with a <b title='guide dog [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_dog">Wiki</a>]'>Seeing Eye dog</b>, she's mine.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Yeah. It would've been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, you know, it's kinda early. Do you wanna maybe come in for some coffee or something?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, gee, (Glances at his watch) it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you think "coffee" means coffee. That is so sweet. Come on, I think I have <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decaffeination">Wiki</a>]'>decaf</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Comes out of the apartment) Oh, good, Stuart. I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Uh, yeah, I guess.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>We're having coffee.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Isn't it a little late for coffee?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'll just go look for it.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>What's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chat room, and I need your help.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What's the topic?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am asserting in the event that Batman's death proves permanent, the original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the <b title='cowl - a large hood that covers your head and shoulders [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsuit">Wiki</a>]'>Bat Cowl</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Ooh, Sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"More wrong"? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to <b title='a mark showing a division on a scale'>gradation</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Of course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable. It's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwing">Wiki</a>]'>Nightwing</b>. A superhero in <b title='have/ achieve sth on his own'>his own right</b>. "Batman Two" has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"Has to be"? "Has to be"? I hope you're being deliberately <b title='intended to make people angry or upset'>provocative</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I found the decaf.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, herbal tea for me, please. (Follows Stuart into Penny's apartment)
<s>The bar.</s>
<i>Raj</i><b title='barkeeper - sb who serves drinks in a bar'>Barkeep</b>, Alexander me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How about those two?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, they're eating peanuts. With my allergies, one kiss would put me in <b title='Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is a non-profit, tertiary 958-bed hospital and multi-specialty academic health science center located in Los Angeles [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center">Wiki</a>]'>Cedars-Sinai</b> for a week.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about the ones in the corner?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Possible. Very possible. You want the one in the <b title='neck brace [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_collar">Wiki</a>]'>whiplash collar</b> or the one who keeps blinking?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think Blinky's cute.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Done, sir.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait. So we just go over there?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. We have a little <b title='preparation'>prep</b> work to do. Put this in your mouth, we walk past them, you <b title='trip, stagger ↗stammer, stutter'>stumble</b> a bit. I say, "Sorry, my friend's had a little too much." And then I start to pull <b title='a scarf'>it</b> out of your mouth and say: "A little too much fun." Get it? I mean, they're laughing, we're laughing. Then we get them up to about a 0.15 blood alcohol level and tell them we're millionaires.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What else you got?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a <b title='sb who can speak without moving their lips '>ventriloquist</b>'s dummy?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I can't sit on your lap. You don't know the routine.
<s>Penny's kitchen.</s>
<i>Stuart</i>I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC Universe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman's parents effectively deprived him of his <b title='the reason why sth exists, why sb does sth etc'>raison d'être</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn't make you right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='on the contrary'>Au contraire</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Plus, you're forgetting that the Infinite Crisis story line restored Joe Chill to the Batman <b title='ideas or opinions that many people have, but that are wrong or not true'>mythology</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am forgetting nothing, and I <b title='feel bitter or angry about sth'>resent</b> your tone.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay. Look, Sheldon, it's late. I've gotta get some sleep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So I win.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No, I'm tired.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So I win.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Fine, you win.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='absolutely'>Darn tooting</b>, I win.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Penny, I really had a terrific time. (She's asleep on the couch) Penny?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No no no no. Don't wake her. She'll <b title='injure (a person or an animal) by tearing his or its flesh'>maul</b> you like a <b title='suffering from rabies'>rabid</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine">Wiki</a>]'>wolverine</b>. (They tiptoes out)<br>
<i>Stuart</i>You know, I don't think that was decaf.
<s>The bar.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Wait, is this your card or isn't it? (The girls leave; to Leonard) Trust me, this was their card.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought you were good at this. You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do. All the time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, what happened? And sitting here all night, the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow, you're just gonna make me come out and say it, aren't you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Say what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're weighing me down. I'm a <b title='a bird of prey [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon">Wiki</a>]'>falcon</b> who hunts better <b title='by oneself'>solo</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine, I'll sit here. You take flight and hunt.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't be ridiculous. You can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, you can. There's a whole <b title='hunting'>sport</b> built around it. <b title='the skill or sport of using falcons to hunt'>Falconry</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Shut up. Let's just get Koothrappali and go. (A fat girl is kissing Raj passionately) Lucky bastard. It's gotta be that stupid accent of his. (To a girl) Hello, I'm Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. (She shakes her head and walks off) Okay, I'm <b title='unable to find an answer or think of a reply'>stumped</b>.
