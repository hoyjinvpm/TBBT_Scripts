<s>Previously on The Big Bang Theory.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Guess who I found at LAX, my baby sister Priya.<br>
<i>Priya</i>It's really nice to see you again, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's good to see you, too. Here you go.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You slept with my sister?!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Raj</i>This's a terrible betrayal of my trust!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and then she kind of stomped on it?<br>
<i>Raj</i>How hard did she stomp?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Very hard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, I'm good.
<s>Bernadette's bedroom.</s>
<i>Howard</i>What's so funny?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do sometimes <b title='get carried away - get very excited or lose control of your feelings'>get a bit carried away</b>, don't I?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It's cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know it's meant as a compliment.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's how I take it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, gotta go.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh! Already? Why don't you stay over?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I'd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's not just the wig. It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It's a two-person job.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It's just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel... cheap.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, honey, I'm sorry. What can I do?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Stay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Go home.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Your <b title='decision'>call</b>, alright?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, have you ever considered us living together?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Boy, I don't know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I've got a better solution.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We wait for my mom's heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just <b title='put sth somewhere quickly and without much care'>stick</b> her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Great.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look at us planning a future together.
<s>Outside Howard's house.</s>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Who's there? Are you a sex criminal?<br>
<i>Howard</i>sex criminals don't have keys, Ma.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Where were you so late?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was out with Bernadette.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I know what that means, I watch <b title='a talk show [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Phil_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Dr. Phil</b>. I hope to God you used a condom!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not having this conversation with you, Ma!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nobody has a disease!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother <b title='a viral disease [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex">Wiki</a>]'>herpes</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>That's it</b>. I don't have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Who's there? Are you a sex criminal?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Still leaving. I just forgot my <b title='a drug used to treat allergies [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loratadine">Wiki</a>]'>Claritin</b>!
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, what's up?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I need a place to <b title="stay at sb's house for the night">crash</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, sure. Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Big fight with my mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Still arguing over which <b title='CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, a.k.a. CSI: Las Vegas, a television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation">Wiki</a>]'>CSI</b> is the best?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard's gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you offer him a hot beverage?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, social <b title='system of rules about the correct way to behave on an official occasion'>protocol</b> states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Tea does sound nice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You heard the man, Leonard. (Snaps his fingers) And while you're at it, I'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?<br>
<i>Howard</i>There's no room. His sister is staying with him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, wait. What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I'm down <b title='depressed; feeling gloomy'>in the dumps</b> here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Priya's in town?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on. When did Priya get here?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, that's a real <b title='a difficult or unpleasant situation'>pickle</b>. Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't worry. As your <b title='third in place, degree, or order'>tertiary</b> friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's not really necessary.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. I'll finish making the tea, while you <b title='narcissistic - thinking about oneself a lot and admire oneself too much'>narcissistically</b> ramble on about whatever's troubling you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's what tertiary friends are for.
<s>Raj's Apartment. Leonard knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's Leonard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You can't come in.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I just wanna talk to her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I forbid it.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Open the door, Rajesh.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You heard me. I forbidded it.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Forbidded it?<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='forbid, forbade, forbidden'>Forbaded</b> it?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Get out of the way. What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Priya</i>I have business in Los Angeles.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why didn't you call?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I'm sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn't sure if seeing you was such a good idea.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know. Last time I <b title='come on to sth - start talking about a subject | come on to sb - behave in a way that shows sb that you want to have a sexual relationship with them'>came on</b> too strong. Can we talk in private?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No!<br>
<i>Priya</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's completely inappropriate for a single woman to <b title=' invite people to eat or drink with you as your guests'>entertain</b> a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I'll be right out here monitoring the situation! (Dials phone) Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. (Dials again) Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
<s>The Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you're welcome to.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly <b title='showing no interest or enthusiasm'>apathetic</b> tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The word is forbade.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don't get to tell me who I can and can't have a relationship with.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, he can. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusm%E1%B9%9Bti">Wiki</a>]'>The Hindu Code of Manu</b> is very clear in these matters. If a woman's father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>There it is, Priya. We're Indian. We believe this stuff.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy. My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Arriving) Who can't go out with Leonard?<br>
<i>Raj</i>My sister.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.<br>
<i>Priya</i>It's very nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, you, too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Penny, you became <b title='disappointed with sb/sth, and no longer believing that they are good | enchant - attract sb strongly'>disenchanted</b> with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Listen, my mom's going to <b title='a desert resort city in Riverside County, California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Palm Springs</b> to visit her sister. That's two whole nights <b title='one after another without a break'>in a row</b> I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her <b title='the spaces in the bone behind the nose'>sinuses</b>, in which case I'll have to <b title='carry or pull sth heavy, lug'>schlep</b> out there with the big humidifier.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's it? That's your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom's nose <b title='hold up - remain strong and working effectively'>holds up</b>, we get two nights together?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Isn't that great?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, it's not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, uh...<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wrong answer.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, wait. You didn't let me finish.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm listening.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh...<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Agh!
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>I came as quickly as I could.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Why?<br>
<i>Amy</i>To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister. So I <b title='hightail it - leave somewhere very quickly'>hightailed it</b> over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Amy, I'm fine.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You don't have to be strong for me. Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Amy</i>In situations like this, best girlfriends are often <b title='bitchy, malicious, spiteful'>catty</b> about the other woman. Rawr.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. <b title='as can be supported or shown by persuasive argument'>Arguably</b> much more suitable than you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Well, good for him. What do you mean, more suitable?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, <b title='used when you admit that sth is true'>granted</b>, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are <b title='quite or to a satisfactory degree'>reasonably</b> <b title='excellent or impressive'>bodacious</b>. But Priya is highly educated, she's an <b title='very skilful'>accomplished</b> professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_Sutra">Kama Sutra</a>]'>the book on neat ways to have sex</b>. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tipping">Wiki</a>]'>tipping cows</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?<br>
<i>Amy</i>This is a portable <b title='Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity along the scalp. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">Wiki</a>]'>electroencephalogram</b>. I'm doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I'm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque">Wiki</a>]'>rhesus monkey</b> and see if he cries. Cool, huh?
<s>Bernadette's apartment. Howard knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Howard</i>I choose you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Really?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep. I moved out of my mother's house. Cord is cut. I'm all yours.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What did she say when you told her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>This is so great. I love you, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I love you, too. So what's for dinner?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, I don't really have much of anything in the house.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's fine. Why don't we go <b title='engage in intimate sexual activities ↗make out, mess around'>fool around</b> in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I'd love that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I love the way you say, I'd love that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>She says it the same way I do. I'd love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It's not a big deal.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Rajesh, don't be a child.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My sister's 38 and married.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='even more than before'>All the more</b> shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's remarkable. If <b title='an American variety of salami, usu made from cured pork and beef mashed together. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperoni">Wiki</a>]'>pepperoni</b> were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Hi. Penny, right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. I don't wanna <b title='expect or ask sb to do sth for you when this is not convenient for them ↗bossy'>impose</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. It's not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are <b title='similiar to'>akin to</b> the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plover">Wiki</a>]'>plover</b>, a small <b title='scavenge - search for decaying flesh as food ↗vulture'>scavenging</b> bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open <b title="animal's stomach or throat">maw,</b> and have at it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn't have to take that.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hi, bestie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?<br>
<i>Priya</i>I know. Pretty boring, huh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, come on. It's not boring at all. She's currently helping set up a secondary <b title='a special type of contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_%28finance%29">Wiki</a>]'>derivative</b> market which would allow overseas car firms to <b title='an investment position intended to offset potential losses/gains that may be incurred by a companion investment [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28finance%29">Wiki</a>]'>hedge</b> their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Thank you, Leonard. That doesn't make it sound boring at all.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, but...<br>
<i>Amy</i>So, how you holding up?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm fine.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Who are you kidding? She's breathtaking.<br>
<i>Priya</i>So, Penny, Leonard tells me you're an actress. That must be pretty exciting.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Nuys,_Los_Angeles">Wiki</a>]'>Van Nuys</b> for an audition I thought was gonna be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you get the <b title='character/role'>part</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I didn't do the audition.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?<br>
<i>Priya</i>I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did <b title='a comedy by William Shakespeare [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew">Wiki</a>]'>Taming of the Shrew</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.<br>
<i>Priya</i>In his tongue.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whose tongue?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, with my tongue in your tail?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute <b title='sb/sth that gives great pleasure or enjoyment'>delight</b>.
<s>Bernadette's bedroom.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow, indeed.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I can't believe we're finally living together.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>A little snack. You got any <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_cheese">Wiki</a>]'>string cheese</b>?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No. I, I might have some <b title='a relatively hard, pale-yellow-to-off-white cheese [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_cheese">Wiki</a>]'>cheddar</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not as good. You can't make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You have <b title='under, below normal ↗hyper'>hypo-</b>allergenic detergent?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my <b title='buttocks'>tuchus</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wait a second. I'm doing your laundry?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I have to take you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You don't have to take me. You <b title='have the opportunity'>get to</b> take me.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's not weird. There's lots of kids there with their moms.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I can't believe this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What? It's fun. If I have no <b title='cavity - a hole in a tooth'>cavities</b> afterwards, we go out for a treat.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>All right, Howard, let's get something straight right now. I'm not going to be your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?
<s>Howard's house.</s>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Who's that? Is it a sex criminal?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Where were you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Didn't you read my email?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>You know I can't turn on that <b title='lousy ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_language">Yiddish</a>])'>fakakteh</b> computer. I left you some <b title='meat that comes from the chest of an animal, esp a cow'>brisket</b> on the kitchen counter.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey. What's up?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I just wanted to check in on you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why?<br>
<i>Amy</i>It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the <b title='smoulder - burn slowly without a flame ↗hot'>smouldering</b> sexuality of a crouched <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_tiger">Wiki</a>]'>Bengal tiger</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I already told you, I'm okay with it. I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased (Starting to <b title='cry'>blub</b>) that Leonard has found someone that makes him so happy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, <b title='↗there, there'>it's okay, it's okay.</b><br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Now, let's get these electrodes attached and see what's going on in that pretty little <b title='head'>noggin</b> of yours.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>I smell Chinese food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's actually Thai. You're <b title='slip - make a careless mistake'>slipping</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are Leonard and Priya here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They went to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Catalina</b> for the weekend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Where's Raj?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>At home, forbidding it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How about Howard?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='I tend to'>I'm given to</b> understand his mother grounded him for <b title='↗elope, run out on, walk out on'>running away</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, okay. Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, it's the three of us.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(On webcam) What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a <b title='suffering shame'>disgraced</b> <b title='Televangelism is the use of television to communicate Christianity.

<i>Penny</i>Not really.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.<br>
