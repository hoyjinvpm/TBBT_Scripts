<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So you see, what you're eating is not technically yogurt. Because it doesn't have enough live <b title='acid-loving milk-bacterium [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidophilus">Wiki</a>]'>acidophilus</b> <b title='bacteria or cells grown for medical or scientific use'>cultures</b>. It's really just ice milk with <b title='widely used in the food industry, for their gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan">Wiki</a>]'>carrageenan</b> added for thickness.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, that's very interesting.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's also not pink and has no berries.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What was your question again?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do you want some?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah. Right. No. I'm <b title='inable to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerant">Wiki</a>]'>lactose intolerant</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, <b title='the condition of having a lot of air in your stomach'>gas</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, got it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, good night. (Hugs and kisses her on the lip) (Caught on a camera above them) (Pushes her towards the opposite wall) (The camera pans and zooms, focusing on Penny's cleavage)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There was a <b title='cold air'>draft</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I didn't feel a draft.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why don't we just go into your...?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah. You know what, maybe we should slow things down a little.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment... to go fast.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I know. I know what you meant. It's just, this is only our first date.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, okay. Sure. No problem. Why don't we just figure out where we're going... ...and when we want to get there? And then <b title='R = D / T'>rate of speed equals distance over time</b>. (Penny looks at him) Solve for R.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Or we could just <b title='do sth without planning or preparing it'>wing it</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That might work too.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night. (Glares at the camera)<br>
[The living room. Howard and Raj are watching the video transferred from the camera.]<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's coming. Screen saver.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, hey, Leonard. How was your date?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='"go to hell"; "leave me alone"; "go away" [<a href="http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/bite-me">Wiki</a>]'>Bite me</b>. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They were clever. They <b title='use sth fully and effectively'>exploited</b> my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you talking about? The date went fine.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, so she said she wants to slow things down. It's like saying, "I'm really enjoying this meal. I'm going to slow down and <b title='fully enjoy'>savor</b> it."<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad, so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out."<br>
<i>Raj</i>You being the fish.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not the fish.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, really? Did you make a second date?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, even I know that's <b title='a lame explanation or excuse is weak and difficult to believe'>lame</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. All right. Let's <b title='think sth is true'>assume</b> your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed. Where could I possibly have gone wrong?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Think back, Leonard. The littlest things can <b title='set off - make a bomb explode, upset sb'>set women off</b>. Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet we could get her to come home with us." Or, "How much does your mom weigh? I wanna know what I'm getting into."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't say anything like that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good, <b title='because'>'cause</b> they don't work.<br>
<i>Raj</i>They also don't <b title='like'>care for</b> it if you stare at them and <b title='breathe too quickly/deeply'>hyperventilate</b>. Sadly, that's my <b title='In baseball, a home run is a base hit in which the batter is able to circle all the bases. swing - the movement you make when you hit the ball in baseball, golf etc'>home run swing</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, everything went fine. I didn't even have to refer to my <b title='done or said without any preparation or planning'>impromptu</b> conversation starters. <b title='Penny'>That woman across the hall</b> <b title='like, be interested in'>is into</b> me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let's go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the good-night kiss. No change in <b title='breathing'>respiration</b>, pupils <b title='dilate - become wider/bigger'>undilated</b>, no <b title='flush - blush'>flushing</b> of the chest.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nice <b title='a photograph or part of a film in which the camera seems to have been very close to the picture it took'>close-up</b>, by the way.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting. Her jaws are <b title='closed tightly together'>clenched</b>. No tongue access. Clearly a bad sign amongst <b title='if animals mate, they have sex to produce babies'>mating</b> humans.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's not a bad sign.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='said when you think what someone has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>Please</b>. You might as well have been two <b title='a large tropical American lizard [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguana">Wiki</a>]'>iguana</b> with no <b title='a hanging piece of loose skin under the neck of an animal'>dewlap</b> enlargement.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not there, because I'm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys, approaches <b title='Warp speed sure makes space travel handy in science fiction... Warp drive is a hypothetical faster-than-light propulsion system in many works, most notably Star Trek. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive">Wiki</a>]'>warp speed</b>. And take down that camera.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Stares at the screen) Give him time.<br>
<s>The Laundry room. Sheldon is using a <b title='[<a href="http://wiki.the-big-bang-theory.com/wiki/FlipFold">Wiki</a>]'>FlipFold</b> to fold his clothes.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, hi, Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, FYl, the hot water is inadequate on Machine 2, so colors only. And four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle. So I'd avoid using that for your <b title='clothes that need to be washed with special care, e. g. bras and underpants'>delicates</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. (Dumps her laundry into a machine)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good Lord. Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Pours a lot of detergent) Sheldon, may I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbid it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, I heard "yes, " so.... Okay, here's my question: Has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity. Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a <b title='a highly intelligent person ↗maniac'>brainiac</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! Well, a few years ago, he <b title='used for emphasis'>did</b> go out with a woman who had a Ph. D. in French literature.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How is that not a brainiac?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. (Folds a pair of socks)<br>
<i>Penny</i>So.... Do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating, he'll eventually get bored with me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That depends.<br>
<i>Penny</i>On what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you have <b title='enough knowledge of'>a working knowledge of</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics">Wiki</a>]'>quantum physics</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you speak <b title='language spoken by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language">Wiki</a>]'>Klingon</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know any card tricks?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. I get it. Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress/actress who felt so insecure, that she lied to him about finishing community college.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would you lie about that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, he was going on and on about this college and that <b title='a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i. e. master&#039;s and doctoral degrees) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_school">Wiki</a>]'>grad school</b> and I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community-college graduate"? (Penny is stunned)<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community-college graduates.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, but you are neither.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right. Okay, look, this is between you and me. You cannot tell Leonard any of this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're asking me to keep a secret?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I'm sorry. You would've had to express that desire before revealing the secret so that I could choose whether I wanted to accept the <b title='legal agreement'>covenant</b> of secret-keeping. You can't impose a secret on an <b title='from sth done afterward [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law">Wiki</a>]'>ex post facto</b> basis.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expressions, <b title='micro movements in response to specific stimuli that are not regulated by conscious effort [<a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_autonomic_reflexes">Wiki</a>]'>autonomic reflexes</b>. When I try to deceive I <b title='used for emphasis'>myself</b> have more nervous <b title='tic - a sudden movement of a muscle in your face'>tics</b> than a <b title='the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease">Wiki</a>]'>Lyme disease</b> research facility. It's a joke. It relies on the <b title='homonym - word spelt and pronounced like another word but with a different meaning'>homonymic</b> relationship between <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick">Wiki</a>]'>tick</b>, the bloodsucking <b title='a member of a large class of animals that includes spiders'>arachnid</b> and tic, the involuntary muscular contraction. (Chuckles) I made it up myself.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Physiologically impossible.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Sheldon, please. Look, I'm asking you as a friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, you're saying that friendship contains within it, an inherent obligation to maintain <b title='secrets'>confidences</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>lnteresting. One more question. Perhaps I should've led with this: when did we become friends?
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>i. e., I couldn't become <b title='the name of several superheroes from the fictional DC Universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern">Wiki</a>]'>Green Lantern</b> unless I was chosen by the <b title='an extra terrestrial race in the DC Comics universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Universe">Wiki</a>]'>Guardians of Oans</b>. Given enough startup capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You could be Batman?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sure. (ln deep voice) I'm Batman. (ln normal voice) See?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi, Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey. Penny, if you're not doing anything Friday night, I thought we could go see a movie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner <b title='a period of work time'>shift</b> on Friday.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. What about Saturday?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, I'm not sure. The manager hasn't posted the schedule yet. How about I let you know?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. So you just let me know when you know. (Penny ignores him) Okay, so... Oh, God, I am the bad fish. What did I do wrong?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why are you asking me? I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs off)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What does that mean?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I didn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I just think you need to be careful how you <b title='express'>phrase</b> things, sir.<br>
[In the living room]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on with you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me but exist between you and Penny, a person to whom I barely speak? (Tics)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's wrong with your face?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's no reason to bring my looks into this. <b title='used to say hello or goodbye'>Good day</b>, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I said, good day. (Leaves the apartment)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good day?
<s>Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Also today we have a fresh-caught Alaska salmon served with a <b title='Teriyaki is a cooking technique used in Japanese cuisine in which foods are broiled or grilled with a glaze (a liquid which is put onto food to give it an attractive shiny surface) of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.

(Sheldon appears)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You must release me from my oath.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I'm working.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To the diners) Why don't you take a minute to decide? (Drags Penny away) I can't keep your secret, Penny. I'm going to fold like an energy-based <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_protein_structure_prediction">Wiki</a>]'>de novo protein in conformational space</b>. Like a Renaissance <b title='religious picture painted on three pieces of wood that are joined together'>triptych</b>. Like a cheap suit. (Penny eventually gets it)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm <b title='in a way that is related to your general character'>constitutionally</b> incapable. That's why I was refused <b title='If you get clearance to do/have sth, you get official approval or permission to do/have it'>clearance</b> for a very <b title='admired as one of the best and most important'>prestigious</b> government research fellowship at a secret military <b title='a high energy particle accelerator'>supercollider</b> located beneath a fake agricultural station, 12.5 miles southeast of Traverse City, Michigan. (Penny is stunned) Which you did not hear about from me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, just forget I told you about me...not graduating from community college, okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Forget? You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a thing since the day my mother stopped breastfeeding me. lt was a <b title='with very light rain falling'>drizzly</b> Tuesday.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Look, You promised me you would keep my secret, so you are just gonna have to figure out a way to do it.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I'm moving out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you mean you're moving out? Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There doesn't have to be a reason.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, there <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> does.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not necessarily. This is a classic example of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma">Wiki</a>]'>Münchhausen trilemma</b>. Either the reason is <b title='based'>predicated</b> on a series of sub-reasons leading to <b title='a return to a previous or less developed state'>regression</b>, or it tracks back to <b title='obviously true, self-evident'>axiomatic</b> statements, or it's ultimately circular i. e., I'm moving out, because I'm moving out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm still confused.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I don't see how I could've made it any simpler.<br>
[Howard and Raj enter]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, <b title="what's up">qu'est-ce que c'up</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human <b title='dead body, corpse'>cadavers</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Some of those skinless <b title='women'>chicks</b> were hot.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless <b title='sexual interest in dead bodies'>necrophilia</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not you, Howard. He says he's moving out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Did you take a Band-Aid off in front of him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did you buy <b title='a generic product does not have a special name to show that it is made by a particular company, no-brand'>generic</b> ketchup? Forget to rinse the sink? Talk to him through the bathroom door?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Adjust the <b title='an instrument used for keeping a room or a machine at a particular temperature'>thermostat</b>? Cook with <b title='the leaves of the coriander plant, used to add flavour to food [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilantro">Wiki</a>]'>cilantro</b>? Pronounce the T in "often"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did you make fun of trains?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't do anything. He's just gone insane.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, we all knew this day was coming.<br>
[Sheldon appears with a bag]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was fast.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the Department of Homeland Security. And <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Connor_%28Terminator%29">Wiki</a>]'>Sarah Connor</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where are you gonna live?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Until I find a permanent place, I will stay with friends.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bye. (Runs away)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, but you can't stay with me. I have a teeny-tiny apartment.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Don't you worry about the residual <b title='a radioactive element'>radium</b> from the <b title='giving out light'>luminous</b> <b title='the round part of a clock, watch etc'>dials</b>?<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Damn it, Sheldon. You said Penny told you a secret. What's the secret?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(In normal voice) Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I promise.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny lied about graduating from community college 'cause she's afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I drank milk that tasted <b title='strange/unusual'>funny</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny thinks I'm too smart for her. That's ridiculous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. Most of your work is extremely <b title='developed or been produced from sth else'>derivative</b>. And don't worry, that's not a secret. Everybody knows.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, hi. Listen. I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>First, I wanna say that it's not Sheldon's fault. He tried very hard to keep your secret. If Howard hadn't drugged him, he would've taken it to his grave.<br>
<i>Penny</i>He told you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, but it's okay. <b title='because of sth or as a result of sth'>Now that</b> we know what the problem is, there's a simple solution.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='a city in Los Angeles County, California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Pasadena</b> City College?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here is playing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacky_Sack">Wiki</a>]'>Hacky Sack</b>, and this girl's gonna be a <b title='sb whose job is to help lawyers do their work'>paralegal</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. I get it, because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a <b title='expensive, fashionable'>fancy</b> college degree.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it's really not that fancy. It's just a city college.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That doesn't matter to me at all.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So it's fine with you if I'm not smart?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Absolutely.<br>
[Penny slams the door]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, this time, I know where I went wrong. Oh, bite me.
