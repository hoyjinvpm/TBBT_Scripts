<s>Outside an apartment building.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, two years later, there's a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, "What the <b title='hell'>heck</b> was all that about?"<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't really <b title='understand'>get</b> it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, see, it took two years for the snail to (she kisses him) not important.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Where do you think this is going?<br>
<i>Howard</i>To be honest, I was hoping at least <b title='touching or kissing the breasts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_metaphors_for_sex">Baseball metaphors for sex</a>]'>second base</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You're so funny. You're like a <b title='stand-up comedy involves one person telling jokes alone as a performance'>stand-up comedian</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A Jewish stand-up comedian, that'd be new.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I was just- never mind.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We do?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sex.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>But, I need to know whether you're looking for a relationship or a <b title='a sexual relationship that lasts for a single night'>one-night stand</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, just to be clear, there's only one correct answer, right? It's not like chicken or fish on an airplane?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Maybe you need to think about it a little.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, it's not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Call me when you figure it out.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Three dates means sex? Who knew?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Greetings, <b title='homey - a friend or sb who comes from your area or gang ↗roomie, roommate'>homies</b>, (To Penny) <b title='-ette - small/female'>homette</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why are you back from your date so early?<br>
<i>Howard</i>In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What exactly does that mean?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He <b title='strikeout – a failure to engage in any form of foreplay or sexual activity'>struck out</b>.
<s>The university cafeteria.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>With Penny and me, it took two years. <b title='used to give an explanation of a new situation'>Now that</b> I think about it, that was three dates.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Arriving) I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What're you talking about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The cultural <b title='model'>paradigm</b> in which people have sex after three dates.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Never mind, what's your announcement?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know-<br>
<i>Barry</i>Hey, Cooper, I hear you're going to be on the wadio with <b title='a radio and television journalist and author who hosts Public Radio International&#039;s popular Science Friday. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Flatow">Wiki</a>]'>Ira Flatow</b> from <b title='a weekly call-in talk show [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Friday">Wiki</a>]'>Science Friday</b> next week.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.<br>
<i>Barry</i>My pleasure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My thank you was not sincere.<br>
<i>Barry</i>But my pleasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did <b title='a privately and publicly funded non-profit membership media organization that serves as a national syndicator to a network of 900 public radio stations in the United States. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">Wiki</a>]'>National Public Radio</b> have to start scraping the bottom of the <b title='a large quantity'>barrel</b> for its guests? Eh, don't answer, it's <b title='a rhetorical question that you ask as a way of making a statement, without expecting an answer'>rhetorical</b>. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. (To the guys) Sorry you had to hear that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you really gonna be on NPR?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of <b title='A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle in particle physics that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or vice-versa). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole">Wiki</a>]'>magnetic monopoles</b> in <b title='A spin ice is a substance that does not have a single minimal-energy state. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_ice">Wiki</a>]'>spin ices</b>. It's <b title="a period where a candidate's grades and behavior were reviewed ↗fraternity, sorority">pledge week</b> and they're trying to <b title='make sth move or work faster'>goose</b> the ratings with a little controversy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Very cool, congratulations.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. My mother is very excited. She's <b title='convene - arrange for people to come together for a formal meeting ↗convention'>convening</b> her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, "Fever 104, aajke naye acchha sangeetka ghar." That means: "Fever 104, home of the really good current music." Much <b title='catchy - pleasing and easily remembered'>catchier</b> in Hindi.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of <b title='graduate - sb who has completed a university degree'>grad</b> work and an original thesis.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>In fact, it's better if you don't, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yo, Raj, talk to me. I'm sorry, just <b title='screw with - joking deceive'>screwing with</b> you. Hey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did she say something?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I'm not sure she's my type.<br>
<i>Penny</i>She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Different how?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, you know, more like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox">Wiki</a>]'>Megan Fox</b> from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film)">Wiki</a>]'>Transformers</b>, or <b title='[<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katee_Sackhoff"">Wiki</a>]'>Katee Sackhoff</b> from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Wiki</a>]'>Battlestar Galactica</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you high?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You'd have a better <b title='chance'>shot</b> with the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycia_Naff">Lycia Naff</a>]'>three-breasted Martian hooker</b> from <b title='a 1990 American science fiction action film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_%281990_film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Total Recall</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, now you're just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how <b title='hanging down'>saggy</b> those things would be.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, you're gonna <b title='waste'>throw away</b> a great girl like Bernadette because you're <b title='hold out for - to not accept anything less than you have asked for'>holding out for</b> some ridiculous fantasy?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, I'm sitting here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Again, I'm right here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I am here, right? You see me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I'm interested in what's inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious <b title='a sticky brown sweet made of boiled sugar, butter, and milk'>caramel</b> that is <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry">Wiki</a>]'>Halle Berry</b>? (Raj whispers something in his ear; to him) Yes, you're delicious caramel, too.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, you know what, I will tell you why it's wrong-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, may I <b title='interrupt what sb is saying with your opinion or a remark'>interject</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly <b title='having an acceptable explanation or reason ↗reasonable, sensible'>justified</b> in seeking out the optimum mate for the <b title='propagate - reproduce ↗propaganda'>propagation</b> of his genetic line.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, whether that propagation <b title='If A is in the interests of B, A will benefit B in some way.'>is in the interest of</b> humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
<s>Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.</s>
<i>Radio</i>This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Oh, this is going to be a <b title='sb/sth that is extremely funny'>riot</b>.<br>
[Cut to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.]<br>
<i>Radio</i>Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My pleasure, Ira.<br>
<i>Ira</i>Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (The pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (Pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.<br>
<i>Ira</i>Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Even higher pitch) No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.<br>
[Cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A requirement for string theory, or <b title='a theory in physics that unifies all of the consistent versions of superstring theory. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory">Wiki</a>]'>M-theory</b>, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the <b title='spout or end-piece of a pipe'>nozzle</b>! I'm going to kill you!
<s>Howard's bathroom. He is in the bath, drinking champagne.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So nice you could join me this evening. You're looking lovely as always.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your <b title="masturbate - touch or rub your or sb else's sexual organs">masturbatory</b> fantasies.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, Katee, don't make it sound so cheap.<br>
<i>Katee</i>I'm sorry, <b title='fiddle - keep moving and touching sth'>fiddling</b> with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you. So, shall we get started?<br>
<i>Katee</i>Sure. But can I ask you a question first?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, You wanna play <b title='a cybernetic civilization in the Battlestar Galactica universe ↗role-play, foreplay'>Cylon</b> and colonist?<br>
<i>Katee</i>No. I want to know why you're playing <b title='when you imagine or pretend that sth is real or true'>make-believe</b> with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You mean, Bernadette?<br>
<i>Katee</i>No, I mean <b title='a fictional character in the Star Wars universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia">Wiki</a>]'>Princess Leia</b>. Of course I mean Bernadette. She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know, but she's not you.<br>
<i>Katee</i>I'm not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? Tall?<br>
<i>Katee</i><b title='6 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to 193 centimeters'>Six-four</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ouch.<br>
<i>Katee</i>The point is, you've got a wonderful girl in your life, and you're ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a <b title='a small square towel used for washing your face or body'>washcloth</b>.<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>Howard! What are you doing in there?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm taking a bath!<br>
<i>Ms. Wolowitz</i>I hope that's all you're doing! We share that tub!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>. <b title='[<a href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/Meat_Loaf:All_Revved_Up_With_No_Place_To_Go">Wiki</a>]'>All Revved Up With No Place To Go</b>.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>How ya doing, buddy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I'm doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, it wasn't that bad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(In a munchkin voice) <b title='The three members of "The Lollipop Guild" performing in The Wizard of Oz. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_film%29">The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)</a>]'>We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It wasn't funny.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I thought it was funny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You laughed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you laugh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can <b title='get sb back - do sth to hurt or harm sb who has hurt or harmed you'>get him back</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I refuse to sink to his level.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You can't sink. With all that helium in you, you're lucky you don't float away.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you really admitting defeat?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I never admit defeat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't think that's possible, dude.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're not helping.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I didn't come to help, I came to mock.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to <b title='if sb exacts revenge (=vengeance), they punish a person who has harmed them'>exact vengeance</b> on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(comics)">Wiki</a>]'>Joker</b> got back at Batman for putting him in the <b title='a fictional psychiatric hospital in the DC Universe, usually appearing in stories featuring Batman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum">Wiki</a>]'>Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned <b title="Gotham City is the fictional home of DC Comics' Batman">Gotham</b>'s water supply.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that'd be untraceable in an <b title='an examination of a dead body to discover the cause of death =post-mortem ↗biopsy'>autopsy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's <b title='tone it down'>dial it back</b> to a non-lethal form of vengeance.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! How about we put a <b title='also known as a farting bag [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopee_cushion">Wiki</a>]'>whoopee cushion</b> on his office chair? He'll sit down, it'll sound like he's <b title='suffering from too much gas in the stomach'>flatulent</b>, even though he's not.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let's keep thinking.

<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She's working today, right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, but I don't think she wants to see you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I've kind of been talking some <b title='offensive speech about sb'>smack</b> about <b title='you'>ya</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hello, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I can't now, I'm working.<br>
<i>Howard</i>This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Is this more comedy that I don't understand?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. I'm serious. I'm never gonna find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So, this isn't a joke?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Then you're insane.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I prefer to think of myself as <b title='unusual, strange'>quirky</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, we've only been on three dates. We haven't even had sex yet.<br>
