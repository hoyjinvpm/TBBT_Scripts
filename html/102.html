<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='here you are'>Here you go</b>. <b title='a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as a street food and at casual local eateries in Thailand. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pad_Thai">Wiki</a>]'>Pad Thai</b>, no peanuts.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But does it have peanut oil?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not sure. Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Since it's not bee season, you can have my <b title='a hormone... in response to physical or mental stress, as from fear or injury... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine">Wiki</a>]'>epinephrine</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are there any chopsticks?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't need chopsticks. This is Thai food.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='said when sth bad starts happening again'>Here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century. Interestingly, they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ask him for a napkin. I <b title='If you dare sb to do sth, you challenge them to prove that they are not frightened of doing it.'>dare</b> you. [Knocks at the door] I'll get it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do I look <b title='swollen'>puffy</b>? I feel puffy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Am I interrupting?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're not swelling, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no, look at my fingers. They're like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_sausage">Wiki</a>]'>Vienna sausages</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sounds like you have company.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They're not going anywhere. (Closes the door) So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you know, it's a <b title='a distributor of cheesecakes and also a restaurant company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecake_Factory">Wiki</a>]'>Cheesecake Factory</b>. People order cheesecake and I bring it to them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah. Um, <b title='anyway'>anyways</b>, I was wondering if you could help me out with something.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Okay, great. I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow and I may not be here, so... (The door opens; Sheldon, Howard and Raj appears) Oh. Hel-hello.<br>
[Howard says something]<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I haven't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Get used to it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. I probably won't. Hey, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Raj. (No response) Still not talking to me, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't take it personally, it's his <b title='any variant or deviant condition from normal'>pathology</b>. He can't talk to women.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case, a cheesecake scented goddess.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, yeah. If it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow, could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No problem.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Great. Here's my spare key. Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, wait.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh... If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film">Wiki</a>]'>Superman</b> movie marathon?<br>
<i>Penny</i>A marathon? Wow. How many Superman movies are there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're kidding, right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman <b title='make a sound by moving quickly through the air'>swooshes</b> down and catches her. Which one was that?<br>
<i>Boys</i>One.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You realize that scene was <b title='full of with'>rife with</b> scientific inaccuracy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, I know, men can't fly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. Let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of <b title='9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 32 ft/s<sup>2</sup>[<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration#Conversions%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration#Conversions">Wiki</a>]'>32 feet per second per second</b>. Superman <b title='come down suddenly with a rushing movement ↗swipe, swoosh'>swoops</b> down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately <b title='after 5.5 seconds'>120 miles an hour</b>, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Unless Superman matches her speed and decelerates.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In what space, sir? In what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the <b title='=sidewalk'>pavement</b>. It'd be a more merciful death.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, your entire argument is <b title='declared/asserted'>predicated</b> on the assumption that Superman's flight is a <b title='sth impressive'>feat</b> of strength.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you listening to yourself? It is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength. It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow sun.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And you don't have a problem with that? How does he fly at night?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonian">Wiki</a>]'>Kryptonian</b> skin cells.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm just gonna go wash up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I have 2, 600 comic books in there. I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Challenge accepted. We're locked out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Also, the pretty girl left.<br>
<s>Ground floor of the apartment building.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(To the deliveryman) Ok. Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken, so you're gonna have to... Oh, you're just gonna be done? Okay. Cool. Thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I hardly think so.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, we don't have a <b title='a flat structure with wheels for moving heavy loads ↗trolley'>dolly</b>, or <b title='used to support abdominal muscles [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081207192115AAJCDar">link</a>]'>lifting belts</b> or any measurable upper-body strength.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendants of <b title='"Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Wiki</a>]'>Archimedes</b>. Give me a <b title='the point on which a lever turns ↗pivot'>fulcrum</b> and a lever and I can move the Earth. It's just a matter of... (Tries to move the huge box and almost collapses) I don't have this. I don't have this! I do not have this!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Helps put the box straight up and then make it lean against a wall) Archimedes would be so proud.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do you have any ideas?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but they all involve a <b title='the name of several superheroes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_lantern">Wiki</a>]'>Green Lantern</b> and a <b title='a ring which is the source of the super powers of the Green Lantern Corps [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ring_(DC_Comics)">Wiki</a>]'>Power ring</b>.<br>
[Leonard and Sheldon are leaning the box against the stairsteps]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Easy...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Easy.<br>
[The box falls]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the <b title='↗cosine, tangent [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine#Values">Wiki</a>]'>sine</b> of the angle of the stairs, call it 30 degrees, so, about half.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Exactly half.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Mocks him) Exactly half. Let's push. Okay. See, it's moving, this is easy. It's all in the math.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's your formula for the corner?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What? Oh. Okay, uh... okay, yeah, no problem. Just come up here, help me pull and turn.<br>
[The box slides down]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, gravity, <b title='you are'>thou art</b> a heartless bitch.<br>
[They are dragging the box along the floor]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having <b title='sexual intercourse'>sexual congress</b> with this woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Men do things for women without expecting sex.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Those would be men who just had sex.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm doing this to be a good neighbor. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds. Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. (Lets go of the box)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we're not. No, we're not.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we're not!<br>
[Finally they manages to get the box into Penny's apartment.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, God, my fingers!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, her... <b title='Perry White&#039;s most well known catchphrases are "Great Caesar&#039;s ghost!" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_White">Wiki</a>]'>Great Caesar's ghost</b>, look at this place.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So Penny's a little messy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A little messy? The <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Mandelbrot_set_image. png/220px-Mandelbrot_set_image.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Wiki</a>]'>Mandelbrot set</b> of complex numbers is a little messy. This is chaos. Excuse me. Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of <b title='knives, forks, and spoons =cutlery ↗crockery (cups, dishes, plates etc), tableware, kitchenware'>flatware</b> on a couch is valid. Now, I'm just inferring that this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table is having a tiny <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_sale">Wiki</a>]'>garage sale</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful <b title='sometimes ↗from time to time'>at times</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, we should go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hang on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm straightening up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, this is not your home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, this is not anyone's home. This is a swirling <b title='a mass of wind or water that spins quickly and pulls things into its center ↗whirlpool'>vortex</b> of <b title='a lack of order in a system [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28order_and_disorder%29">Wiki</a>]'>entropy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When the <b title='sb, esp a man, who enjoys dressing like a person of the opposite sex =cross-dresser'>transvestite</b> lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because it was <b title='perfectly clean and tidy; spotless'>immaculate</b>. I mean, you opened that man's closet, it was left to right evening <b title="woman's dress, esp a long one for special occasions">gowns</b>, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What were you doing in his closet?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I helped him run some cable for a <b title='a camera which records moving pictures and sound and allows these to be broadcast on the Internet as they happen'>web cam</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, Penny. This just arrived, we justbrought this up... just now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, we'll <b title='stop bothering/annoying/bugging you'>get out of your hair</b>. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, great. Thank you again. (Tosses her jacket on the couch)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Upset) Penny... (Leonard comes back) I just want you to know that you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To Leonard) What's he talking about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's a joke.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't get it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, he didn't tell it right. (Drags Sheldon out)
<s>Leonard's bedroom. He is in bed when he hears some noise.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon? (Comes out with a <b title='an energy weapon featured in the Star Wars universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">Wiki</a>]'>lightsaber</b>.) Sheldon? Hello? (Notices that the apartment door is open; turns off the lightsaber)<br>
[Penny's living room. Sheldon is tidying; Leonard comes in]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Shh, shh, shh. Penny's sleeping.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you insane? You can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I just gave you a reasonable explanation.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, you gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your <b title='your peers are the people who are the same age as you, or who have the same type of job, social class etc'>peers</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, we have to get out of here. (Penny snores)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You might want to speak in a lower <b title='range of a human voice or a musical instrument'>register</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Evolution has made women sensitive to high-pitched noises while they sleep so that they'll be <b title='rouse - wake sb who is sleeping deeply'>roused</b> by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking<br>
her, speak in a lower register.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's ridiculous! (Penny snores)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. (In a lower register) "That's ridiculous."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(In a lower register) Fine. I accept your <b title='a statement/idea that you accept as true and use as a base for developing other ideas'>premise</b>. Now, please, let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(In a lower register) I'm not leaving until I'm done. If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(In a lower register) Oh, what the hell.<br>
[Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. The next morning.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Morning.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have to say I slept splendidly. <b title='used when you admit that sth is true'>Granted</b>, not long, but just deeply and well.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not surprised. A well-known <b title='home remedy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_cure">Wiki</a>]'>folk cure</b> for <b title='a medical condition in which you have difficulty sleeping [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia">Wiki</a>]'>insomnia</b> is to break in your neighbor's apartment and clean.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sarcasm?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You think?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement to Penny's quality of life.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You've convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and <b title='wash hair, carpets etc with shampoo'>shampoo</b> her carpet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't think that crosses a line?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have a sarcasm sign?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you want some cereal? I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose from the low-fiber end of the shelf. Hello, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Puffs">Wiki</a>]'>Honey Puffs</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Yells in her apartment) <b title='used when you are annoyed or surprised. bitch≠whore'>Son of a bitch</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny's up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You sick geeky bastards!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How did she know it was us?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I may have left a suggested organizational <b title='a structural/procedural diagram'>schematic</b> for her bedroom closet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>God, this is gonna be bad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good-bye, Honey Puffs. Hello, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisin_Bran">Wiki</a>]'>Big Bran</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Storms in) You came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, but only to clean.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really more to organize. You're not actually dirty, <b title='intrinsicly. intrinsic - being part of the nature or character of sb/sth'>per se</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Give me back my key.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm very, very sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do you understand how creepy this is?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yes, we discussed it <b title='for a long time'>at length</b> last night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>In my apartment, while I was sleeping?!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And snoring. And that's probably just a <b title='Your sinuses are the spaces in the bone behind your nose [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_infection">Wiki</a>]'>sinus infection</b>. But it could be sleep <b title='temporary absence/cessation (pause/stop) of breathing'>apnea</b>. You might want to see an otolaryngologist. (Penny is stunned) A throat doctor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Approaches in a threatening way) And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Depending on the depth, that's either a... <b title='dealing with disorders of the rectum, anus, and colon. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctologist">Wiki</a>]'>proctologist</b> or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sheet of paper which reads "SAICASM") Oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>God! (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, look, now, Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little less... for lack of a better word- <b title='raped'>violated</b>, maybe we can talk about this some more.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Stay away from me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, that's another way to go. Penny, Penny! Hold on. Just to clarify, because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the <b title='the introduction of sth such as a new law or new system'>imposition</b> of a new organizational <b title='a model for sth which explains it or shows how it can be produced'>paradigm</b>.<br>
(Penny leaves without saying anything) Well, that was a little non-responsive.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize. (Sheldon giggles and heads for the kitchen counter) What's funny?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That wasn't sarcasm?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. (Motions to him to go)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Whoo, boy, you are <b title='not correct or suitable'>all over the place</b> this morning. (Go across the hallway and knocks at Penny's door; to himself) I have a master's and two Ph. D.s, I should not have to do this.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am truly sorry for what happened last night. I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't <b title="colour sb's judgement/opinions/attitudes etc - influence the way sb thinks about sth, esp so that they become less fair/reasonable">color your opinion</b> of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and <b title='sb who is thorough is always very careful'>thorough</b> lover. (Leonard, who is at the door of their apartment, covers his face with his hands in exasperation; Penny slams the door without saying anything; Sheldon comes back; to Leonard) I did what I could.
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Raj. Hey, listen. I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it. I mean, they just... they let themselves into my place and then they cleaned it. I mean can you even believe that? How weird is it?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(In his mind) She's standing very close to me. Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>, she <b title='used for emphasis'>does</b> smell good. What is that, vanilla?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, where I come from, if someone comes into your house at night, you shoot. Okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(In his mind) She's so <b title='liking to talk a lot in a friendly way ↗talkative, expansive'>chatty</b>. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd <b title='be in a better situation'>be better off</b> with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just... I'm having a really rough time. Like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend and... (Raj sings something in Indian in his mind) I mean, just because most of the men<br>
I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?<br>
<i>Raj</i>She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Nods)<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're <b title='a very nice person'>a doll</b>. (Hugs him)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Uh-oh. Turn your <b title='the wide, curved group of bones at the level of your hips ↗erection'>pelvis</b>.

<i>Leonard</i>It's fine. You win.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Sheldon) What's his problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title="I've had the same experience">Been there</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hello. Sorry I'm late, but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? You, Rajesh Koothrappali, spoke to Penny?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Actually, I was less the <b title='↗employer, employee, trainer, trainee, trustee'>chatter than the chat-ee</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did she say? Is she still mad at me?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, she was upset at first, but probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you, and then she hugged me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She hugged you? How'd she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard) Is that her perfume I smell?<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='making you feel happy, excited, and unable to think clearly'>Intoxicating</b>, isn't it? (Howard hugs Raj in an intoxicated way)
<s>At Penny's door. Leonard is slipping a note under the door. The door opens.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um... here's the thing. (Finds the note is upside-down; turns it and reads from it) "Penny, "just as <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer">Wiki</a>]'>Oppenheimer</b> came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgment. (Penny smiles; but he is not looking at her) The <b title='most typical quality/feature'>hallmark</b> of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Wiki</a>]'>Madam Curie</b>'s discovery of radium, turned out to have great scientific potential, even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of <b title='a virus [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola">Wiki</a>]'>Ebola</b> research..."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard?<br>
k Yeah?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Hugs him) We're okay. (Kisses him on the cheek and closes the door)<br>
[Leonard goes back to his apartment in an intoxicated way and hits his head on the door]

<i>Leonard</i>One package <b title='"crosshead" screw [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_F._Phillips">Wiki</a>]'>Phillips head screws</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Check.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay? I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12. I think I can put together a cheap, Swedish media center.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, please. We insist. It's the least we can do, considering...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Considering what? How great this place looks?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, boy. I was afraid of this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>These instructions are a <b title='pictograph - a picture representing a word or idea'>pictographic</b> representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This, right here is why Sweden has no space program.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, it-it looked pretty good in the store.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It is an inefficient design. For example, Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We could put her stereo back there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And control it how?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Run an <b title='↗ultraviolet'>infrared</b> <b title='an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power'>repeater</b>. <b title='a light-controlled variable resistor [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor">Wiki</a>]'>Photo cell</b> here, emitter here, <b title='very easy'>easy-peasy</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispered something in his ear) Good point. How are you gonna cool it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys, I got this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hang on, Penny. How about fans? Here and here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Also inefficient, and might be loud.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How about liquid <b title='a liquid or gas used to cool sth'>coolant</b>? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter-inch <b title='a type of plastic [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride">Wiki</a>]'>PVC</b>...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Guys, this is actually really simple.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hold on, honey. Men at work. The PVC comes down here. Maybe a little <b title='in the shape of waves or folds'>corrugated</b> sheet metal as a radiator here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, really? Show me where we put a drip tray, a <b title='a passage that water flows along, with a gate called a sluice gate that can be opened or closed to control the flow'>sluice</b>, and an overflow reservoir.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hey, if water's involved, we're gonna have to <b title='make a piece of electrical equipment safe by connecting it to the ground with a wire'>ground</b> the crap out of the thing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Guys, it's hot in here. I think I'll just take off all my clothes. (No response)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I've got it. What about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, right. Then the entire thing is one big heat sink.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Perfect. Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up about six <b title='waste or unwanted articles'>square</b> meters of scrap aluminum? Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxy-acetylene_torch'>oxyacetylene torch</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Meet back here in an hour?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Done.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it.<br>
[The guys leave]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, this place does look pretty good.
