<i>Howard</i>How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now you just being silly. Wolverine's never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. (Answering phone) Hello. Yes, the elevator's out of order you'll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means, that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do you think they gave Wolverine an <b title='a fictional metal alloy'>Adamantium</b> prostate?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's a stupid question.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We're having a conversation about probing the <b title='heinie - buttocks'>heinies</b> of superheroes. There are no stupid questions. (Sheldon nods)<br>

<i>Man</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, um, is Penny here?<br>
<i>Man</i>You're Leonard, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Man</i>Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, good. Context.<br>
<i>Penny's Dad</i>Come on in, buddy. <b title='sit down and relax'>Take a load off</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can't stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I'll see you later. (Kisses him passionately) Bye.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was odd.

<i>Sheldon</i>Are you sure you have enough comics? You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you've only selected seven hours of reading material. That's even <b title='factor - include a particular fact or situation when you are thinking about or planning sth'>factoring</b> in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like <b title='the sound Nightcrawler makes when teleporting [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamf">Wiki</a>]'>Bamf</b> and <b title='the sound effect of Wolverine&#039;s claws being extended [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine:_Snikt!">Wiki</a>]'>Snikt</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is that racist? It feels racist.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't be oversensitive. He's calling you illiterate, not your race.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, okay. Good. I don't need more comics. Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play <b title='↗galaxy'>intergalactic</b> battleship and Indian Monopoly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't <b title='like'>care for</b> novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon">Wiki</a>]'>Klingon</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Actually, Indian Monopoly's just like regular, except the money's in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of <b title='an infection of the bowels that causes severe diarrhoea with loss of blood'>dysentery</b>. Oh, just FYI, that was racist.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You'll never guess what just happened.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the <b title='↗auditorium, crematorium, sanatorium'>thinkatorium</b> by <b title='telepathy - the direct communication of thoughts or feelings from one person to another without using speech, writing, or any other normal method'>telepathically</b> controlled flying dolphins?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Aw.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny kissed me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, who would ever guess that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What- what kind of a kiss?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A big kiss. On the mouth.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe she was trying to send you a message.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You think?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. This man is not my father. I'm being held hostage. So, I'm gonna do something insane in the hopes that you'll call 911.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is <b title='Cocoa Puffs is a brand of chocolate-flavored puffed grain breakfast cereal.

<i>Leonard</i>I'm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it's nice to hear the <b title='hit - sth such as a film, play, song etc that is very popular and successful'>hits</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why do I bother talking to you people?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(At door) Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So you're probably wondering what that was all about.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kinda told my father we got back together again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What? Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you're the first guy he's ever really approved of, you know? You're a scientist who went to college and you don't have a neck tattoo or <b title='an outstanding arrest warrant is an arrest warrant that has not been served.'>outstanding warrants</b> or, or a baby.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What kind of guys did you used to go out with?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept <b title='↗nag'>bugging</b> me, how's Leonard? why can't you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never <b title='cow tipping - sneaking up on an unsuspecting upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tipping">Wiki</a>] ↗Cars (film), Lightning McQueen, Mater'>tipped a cow over</b> on himself. So, to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? How, how'd we manage that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, did you apologize? Did you have to <b title='persuade (a woman) to marry one =court'>woo</b> me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, no, I don't think so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, why are you arguing about this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm just saying, if we fake got back together, that's totally not how it fake happened.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of <b title='pretended ↗make-believe, fraud'>sham</b> play acting and kissing? Cause I'm good with that.<br>
<i>Penny's Dad</i>Penny, you out here? (Leonard hugs Penny and kisses her)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.<br>
<i>Penny's Dad</i>Relax, I've seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See? He doesn't mind.<br>
<i>Penny's Dad</i>So, Leonard, I'm taking your <b title='girl/woman'>gal</b> out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, I do, I have to work. But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come here, you. (Kisses her again)

<i>Howard</i>C-7.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Miss.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Not if it has a hole in the middle.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?<br>
<i>Raj</i>A <b title='a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid species in the science fiction franchise Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulan">Wiki</a>]'>Romulan</b> battle bagel?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Knock-knock.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So where's the telescope?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He's hoping to see <b title='a star [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Eridani">Wiki</a>]'>Epsilon Eridani</b> dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?<br>

<i>Raj</i>Excuse me. I can't be drinking, I'm about to make an important scientific discovery here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.<br>
<i>Raj</i>How do you know that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, he was Italian. It's a reasonable assumption.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, can you even open your mouth without <b title='spew - say a lot of bad or negative things very quickly'>spewing</b> a cultural stereotype?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I, I'm sorry, Galileo drank <b title='a clear, lemon-lime low-calorie soft drink produced by The Coca-Cola Company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_Zero">Wiki</a>]'>diet sprite</b>. Look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>My pleasure. It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's that knows how to use a napkin.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So not funny, dad.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, will you please let it go?<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A lot of people are doing that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, see?<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom's <b title='Toyota Camry'>Camry</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that's great. It's a funny story. Moving on.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get <b title='a drinking game [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_pong">Wiki</a>]'>beer pong</b> into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>I don't know. That petition looked real to me.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Maybe I could go in a little late.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, no, you can't. Your career is far too important.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't I know it.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>Well, good night, son.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>It won't help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah. Like his haircut material.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. I got them all cut.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Which is still so funny.<br>

<i>Penny</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't you think that's something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Maybe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, Penny, excellent. I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God. What personal habits?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this because Leonard and I are not-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you wanna include him in this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Include me in what? Is there a plot <b title='being planned or happening'>afoot</b>? I'll <b title='refuse to accept, consider, or deal with'>have no truck with</b> plots.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you're right. No, there's, there's no plots, no trucks, no <b title='↗afoot'>feet</b>. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, we don't discuss anything. Leonard is the <b title='one of the people, organizations, or countries that signs an official agreement ↗signature, autograph'>signatory</b> to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your <b title='infraction - breaking of a rule, law, etc, breach'>infractions</b> and must pay all fines.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>Well, <b title='you live and learn - you have just discovered something that you did not know'>live and learn</b>. So, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Maybe. If it did, I'd be famous. I'd be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That sounds great.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We'd come visit you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, you wouldn't. You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hold on. He could come back.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, what's the point of everything?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nope. He's gone.<br>

<i>Penny</i>You know, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>You're a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about 'em.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.<br>
<i>Wyatt</i>Thank you. Now, why don't you go and put some clothes on and we'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport.
