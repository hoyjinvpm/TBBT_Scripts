<i>Sheldon</i>Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, I'd like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can't. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, (Picks up an action figure) and the only guy I know lucky enough to be <b title='immortalize - prevent sb/sth from being forgotten in the future'>immortalized</b> in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun, for my friend, Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm happy to be here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Cut.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Wooden?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't worry, it wasn't terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My friend, Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, Wil, what do you have for us first?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what's interesting about this flag-<br>
<i>Amy</i>Cut.<br>
<i>Wil</i>What was wrong with that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>It's called Fun with Flags. They're not at <b title='if a flag is flying at half-mast, it has been raised to the middle of the pole in order to show respect and sadness for someone who has died'>half-mast</b>, nobody died. Let's try and keep it <b title='positive'>upbeat</b>.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Um, no offence, but I've been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_NIMH">Wiki</a>]'>The Secret of NIMH</b>. You <b title='↗touching'>moved</b> me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You'll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.<br>
<i>Wil</i>So do I.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Great. So, this time let's try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.<br>
<i>Wil</i>And cut. You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, Wil, (Long pause) what do you have for us first?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Cut.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Problem, first-time director?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got <b title='if you get goose bumps, very small lumps appear on your skin and your hairs stand up straight, because you are cold, frightened, or excited'>goose bumps</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>He was overacting on purpose.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? He reminded me of a young <b title='a Canadian actor, musician, singer, author, film director, spokesman and comedian [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shatner">Wiki</a>]'>William Shatner</b>.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you, but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You gonna let him speak to me like that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, you're my girlfriend and I don't want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend and I don't want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a <b title='be on a sticky wicket - be in a situation that will cause problems for you ↗in a pickle, dilemma'>sticky wicket</b>. (To Wil) What do you think?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Can I speak to you for a second?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll be right back. (Gives him the action figure) Feel free to play with yourself. (Wil plays it)<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't <b title='like'>care for</b> your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Fine. Then maybe I should go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I'll see you at dinner tonight?<br>
<i>Amy</i>You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to add sth that you have just realized or remembered'>Come to think of it</b>, I would! You, little lady, are <b title='good; performing well'>on fire</b>.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You ready to go?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't understand why you keep your stuff here when there's plenty of room at home.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric <b title='Body grooming is the act of hair removal, shaving, styling or trimming hair of the male body. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_grooming">Wiki</a>]'>body groomer</b>. Ooh, there's my <b title='a pattern of crossed lines and squares'>plaid</b> <b title='a piece of clothing worn around the neck to fill the space left by an open collar'>dickie</b>. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>50 cents sounds right. Let's go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, it's kinda late. Why don't we just spend the night here?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Because we don't live here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's not true.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Howard, I'm doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>There's some underwear in the hamper.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Oh, good, I got that new <b title='<img

<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was out <b title='raise hell - make/cause trouble'>raising heck</b> with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would've closed down the HomeTown Buffet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought you had plans with Amy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got <b title='in a bad mood'>huffy</b> and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, quite the <b title='fuss, commotion'>kerfuffle</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then Amy got mad and left?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Walked right out the door.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why's that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're just repeating what I said. It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Trust me, call her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us, 'cause the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_pie">Wiki</a>]'>humble pie</b>, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(On skype) What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You'll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me. Tell him you're not mad at me. Go ahead, <b title='set sb straight - tell sb the right way to do sth or the true facts about sth'>set him straight</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm mad at you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hmm. Eat one of your <b title='a brand of nutrition bar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUNA_Bar">Wiki</a>]'>LUNA Bars</b>. Very often when women think they're angry, they're really just hungry.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Precisely, I didn't do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend, and you should've taken my side. That's it. End of story. Good night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.

<i>Penny</i>Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Kitchen <b title='very busy'>slammed</b> again?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What's your excuse this time?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No excuse. It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one's on God.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of <b title='[<a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1452611/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Not-Eat-Pork-or-Crab.htm">Why Do Jews Not Eat Pork or Crab?</a>]'>bacon cheeseburger</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>My religion's kinda <b title='very loose or relaxed'>loosey-goosey</b>. Basically, as long as you got your <b title='(Yiddish) penis'>schmekel</b> <b title='↗circumcise, foreskin'>clipped</b> and <b title='[<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101102065252AAzfQtk">Why do Jewish people not like the Cross?</a>]'>don't wear a cross</b>, you're good.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie, you promised you'd move.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And I will.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I will. I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I've seen her <b title='cause a baby to bring up wind from the stomach'>burp</b> you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don't you have other tables you should be waiting on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm starting to think you're right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, I've had enough of this. I'm a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I've been to space. I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't need anyone <b title='badger - try to persuade sb by asking them sth several times =pester ↗nag'>badgering</b> me into it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, excuse me. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Howard</i>That was just <b title='in order to help, guide, instruct, etc her'>for her benefit</b>. I'll move tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.
<s>Amy's apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy. Amy. Angry Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>First of all, you're welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's <b title='the total output of a writer or artist ↗portfolio'>body of work</b>, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I'll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy- (Amy opens door, grabs DVDs, slams door again) She's hooked.

<i>Raj</i>Wow. An end of an era.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Boy, if these walls could talk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They'd say, why does he <b title='masturbate'>touch himself</b> so much?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. I can't believe I'm not gonna live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M'S, went into my first <b title='a serious medical reaction caused by sb eating or touching sth that they are allergic to'>anaphylactic shock</b> and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a <b title='a brand name chocolate bar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snickers">Wiki</a>]'>Snickers</b>, went into my second anaphylactic shock.<br>
<i>Raj</i>When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sometime around the third <b title='a candy bar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond_Joy">Wiki</a>]'>Almond Joy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. You wanna start loading this stuff into the truck?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favor? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not standing outside by the <b title='a moving equipment and storage rental company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Haul">Wiki</a>]'>U-Haul</b> while you <b title='caress, stroke'>fondle</b> yourself.
<i>Howard</i>Fine, let's go.<br>
<s>The Cheesecake Factory Bar.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey. What brings you in?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a conversation about girls.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting <b title='soft hair'>fuzz</b> in weird places?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, please, I'm <b title='on the horns of a dilemma - faced with a choice betwen things that are equally undesirable '>on the horns of a relationship dilemma</b>. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it's been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's gonna <b title='not cut it - to not be good enough to do sth'>cut it</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Will that calm my nerves?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sold.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. So, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(disambiguation)">The Wizard of Oz</a>]'>the heart you got from the wizard</b> giving you trouble?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The trouble isn't with me, Penny, it's with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that <b title='male: XY female: XX'>second X chromosome</b> contains nothing but nonsense and <b title='nonsense'>twaddle</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is <b title='baffle - confuse, puzzle'>baffling</b> because they're both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they're bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Honey, you can't make people like each other.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was <b title='sth that is very difficult to deal with or do'>a hard row to hoe</b>. Cheers, pal. (Drinks his tea) Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that's hard to <b title='defeat'>beat</b>. Get the <b title=' a fictional character in Alice&#039;s Adventures in Wonderland [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hatter">Wiki</a>]'>Mad Hatter</b> <b title='on the telephone'>on the horn</b>, I'm having a tea party. (Downs the tea)<br>
<i>Penny</i>You might wanna pace yourself.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I'm doing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My problem is I'm out of tea.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, please, I think I've evolved beyond my simple <b title='typical of the country or of country people; simple'>rustic</b> <b title='the way that parents take care of their children and teach them to behave'>upbringing</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>On the other hand, that <b title='dishonest and unkind'>low-down</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polecat">Wiki</a>]'>polecat</b> done <b title='wrong - treat or judge sb unfairly'>wronged</b> my woman.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Welcome to Long Island, Tex.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the <b title='[<a href="an American snack food company">Wiki</a>]'>Planters</b> deluxe mix, she eats all the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_nut">Wiki</a>]'>Brazil nuts</b> so I don't have to look at them. She's a unique blend of saint and <b title='she eats all the Brazil nuts'>squirrel</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that she is. Here you go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm a <b title='not caring that other people are suffering'>callous</b> <b title='sb who behaves in an unreasonable or crazy way because they think that they and their ideas are extremely important; ego + maniac'>egomaniac</b>. She's gonna leave me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, she won't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, she won't. I'm great.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother's house. You are now the only woman in my life who I'll see naked in the bathroom.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I know this wasn't easy. You doing okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I'm fine. It's just her I'm worried about.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Aw, she'll be okay. She's a grown woman.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know. It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's a lot for a kid to deal with.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and <b title="Ben & Jerry's is an American ice cream company">Ben and Jerry</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>She's lucky you were there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Aw, crap. Let's go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Where we going?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Grab a box. We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, but I want to live here.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, you should've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can't we talk about this?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No husband of mine is gonna break his mother's heart!
<s>Wil Wheaton's house.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wil Wheaton! Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Hey, Sheldon, what's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wouldn't you like to know?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Have you been drinking?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just tea. The best tea I've ever had.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Why are you here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll tell you. I'm from Texas. Need I say more?<br>
<i>Wil</i>Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You insulted my woman. I'm here to defend her honor. Two! It was two. (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we're gonna fight?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant invisible cow. They're up to beat an apology out of you.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Okay, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Are you okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your <b title='shrubbery - an area planted with shrubs'>shrubberies</b> do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I'll choose. (Vomits) You were so good in <b title='a 1986 American coming of age drama comedy film...

<i>Sheldon</i>Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I'm pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.<br>
<i>LeVar</i>Hey, Sheldon, it's a pleasure to be here. Well, we've got some interesting flags for-<br>
<i>Amy</i>Cut. <b title='used as an expression of surprise or slight fear'>Yikes</b>, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know what she's talking about, but I'm obligated to agree with her. She's my girlfriend.<br>
<i>LeVar</i>Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?
