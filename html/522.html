<s>The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I'll tell you. A <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen">Wiki</a>] 地衣'>lichen</b> is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae">Wiki</a>]'>algae</b>. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, uh, I'd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wrong. Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital <b title='distance round sth of approximately cylindrical shape ↗bore, calibre, circumference, perimeter'>girth</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Kangaroo, uh, I'd be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to <b title='jump up by the basket and throw the ball down into it'>dunk</b> a basketball.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, <b title='imagine'>picture</b> this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive <b title='operating a "concession stand" within a venue ↗popcorn, cinema'>concessions</b>. Because as an algae, I'll just <b title='eat snack'>snack</b> on this sunlight.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He got us again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, he didn't.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you're half swan.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I've been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said they can get us a great price if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You don't want strippers? You're the king of strippers. That one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What can I tell ya, I'm not <b title='be into - like ↗care for, dig'>into</b> that stuff any more.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you. And still, you're the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, it's probably not for me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They've got that wine train.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='a sound that people make to show that they do not like an actor, speaker etc'>Boo</b>, wine! But yay, trains. I'm in.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There's a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It's magic.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So, I hear you and the <b title='from Peter Pan [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Boys_(Peter_Pan)">Wiki</a>]'>lost boys</b> are having a bachelor party tonight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and <b title='↗bourbon'>Scotch</b>. Nothing to worry about.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why should I worry?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I don't know. It's a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn't that make you a little jealous?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on Leonard, it's you. What's gonna happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you'd do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, I am a young man in his sexual <b title='the time in your life when you are strongest and most active'>prime</b>. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? What is the craziest thing you've ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, come on, that's gotta count. There was a really strong <b title='the water current under the surface of the sea, that pulls away from the land when a wave comes onto the shore ↗tow truck'>undertow</b>, we could've died.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, have fun tonight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, there is.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid get through their <b title='a college admissions test in the United States. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>SATs</b>.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, I gotta <b title='used to say that sb deserves praise for sth'>hand it to</b> Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it <b title='↗suck'>stinks</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you drinking whisky?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Indeed. If I'm to participate in the social convention that is the <b title="a night before a man's wedding ↗hen party">stag night</b>, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. <b title='used to express surprise or annoyance'>Jeepers</b>! That's yucky.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_Corps">Wiki</a>]'>J-bombs</b>, don't you think?<br>
<i>Wil Wheaton</i>Hey, you guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at <b title='born in 1937 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Takei">Wiki</a>]'>George Takei</b>'s house.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm confused. I thought since our <b title='a situation in which two people, countries etc become friendly with each other again after quarrelling'>reconciliation</b>, I was your friend in this group.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. I guess you're just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, no worries.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>And maybe a few bucks for the <b title='male servant ↗butler, maid'>valet</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, all right.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>And gas money to get home.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, sure.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Great. You know what? This is my grandfather's watch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Stuart</i><b title='18K. also karat, a unit for measuring how pure gold is'>18-carat</b> gold, got it in Europe during the war.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow, that's very nice.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it's yours.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he's a jolly good fellow-<br>
<i>All</i>(Joining in) For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Yes, yes, yes. He's a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the <b title='stripers arrive'>stwippers awwive</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Actually, Barry, we're not gonna have strippers tonight.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Ah, then what the <b title='frig - fuck'>fwig</b> did I get <b title='200 one-dollar bills'>two hundwed dowwaws in singles</b> out for?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>You wanna buy a watch?
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>(Into a mini-cam) This is Maid of Honor Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let's check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who's about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you're doing?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Um, these are gift bags we're gonna put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie's relatives, we have <b title='antihistamine - a drug that is used to treat an allergy'>antihistamines</b>, <b title='a substance that reduces the level of acid in the stomach, anti-acid'>antacids</b>, and medicine for diarrhoea and <b title='↗laxative'>constipation</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.<br>
<i>Amy</i>All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you'll be <b title='consummate - make a marriage complete by having sexual intercourse'>consummating</b> your marriage. What do you think your first <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_position">Wiki</a>]'>sexual position</b> will be as husband and wife?<br>
{<i>Ross</i>Ok, you know- you know- this's- I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll-I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!<br>
<i>Judge</i>That won't be necessary.

<i>Bernadette</i>Amy, please.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Keeping in mind that whoever's on top may set the tone for the marriage.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, show's over.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don't you think the kid might get a <b title='a strong feeling of excitement and pleasure'>kick</b> out of knowing how it happened?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't care. Ask her things like are you gonna take Howard's name? Not who's gonna sit on who?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I've actually been thinking I'm going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone <b title='snap up - buy sth immediately, esp because it is very cheap'>snaps it up</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbors.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's cool.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.
<s>The restaurant.</s>
<i>Raj</i>May I have your attention, please? We are here tonight to celebrate the upcoming <b title='wedding'>nuptials</b> of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.<br>
<i>All</i><b title=' It represents a listener&#039;s agreement with the point being made by a speaker. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear,_hear">Wiki</a>]'>Hear! Hear!</b><br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And, apparently, Wil Wheaton's best friend.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Talk to the hand. (Shows him his hand)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Does anyone have any words they'd like to say about our man of the evening?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humor <b title="at sb's expense - at sb who has behaved foolishly, been tricked etc">at Howard's expense</b>. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let's see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that's a <b title='a clever humorous remark that might also be insulting'>zinger</b>, because you're not. I've always thought that you'd <b title='have a quality'>make</b> someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you'd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don't see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don't!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, Howard Wolowitz <b title='tie the knot - get married'>tying the knot</b>. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kinda were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn't even wearing my <b title='[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A7141123011%2Ck%3Aaqua%20socks">link</a>] ↗[<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_shoe  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_shoe%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_shoe">Water shoe</a>]'>aqua socks</b>. Then-<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Nobody cares, Hofstadter. <b title='wrap it up - usu used as an order to tell sb to stop talking or causing trouble etc'>Wwap it up</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. To Howard.<br>
<i>All</i>To Howard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I totally had sex in the ocean.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay, I'll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can't help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I'm 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who, who's next?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>I'll go. Howard, I'm gonna say something to you that evewybody's thinking but no one has the couwage to say out <b title='loud'>woud</b>. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast <b title='nipple cover [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasties">Wiki</a>]'>pasties</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-string">Wiki</a>]'>G-stwings</b>. That's not unweasonable.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hear, hear.<br>
<i>All</i>Hear, hear.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This <b title='a cocktail [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_(cocktail)">Wiki</a>]'>grasshopper</b> is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Yeah, nice speech, <b title='Francine - a female name'>Fwancine</b>. (Tucks a dollar in Raj's pants.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She was my <b title='a child of a cousin of one of your parents'>second cousin</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and-and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little <b title='kosher food is prepared according to Jewish law'>kosher</b> pickle. Of all the Howard <b title='hump - have sex with'>humping</b> hookers stories, that one's my favorite!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, oh, what about that <b title='short and slightly fat ↗tub, chubby'>tubby</b> girl in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon">Wiki</a>]'>Sailor Moon</b> costume at Comic-con?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't remember. Please sit down.<br>
<i>Raj</i>The only <b title='3P'>threesome</b> I've ever had in my whole life, and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, please shut up.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, oh, don't get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.<br>
<i>Wil</i>(Filming on his phone) Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Jeepers, I'm drunk.
<s>Bernadette's car.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you for picking us up. There's a warning, right there, on the Scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin' heavy machinery after you had a <b title='a sufficient amount of liquor to cause intoxication'>snootful</b> of this, <b title='boy, young man (Scottish) ↗lad, lass, lassie'>laddie</b>!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Funny. You boys have a nice time?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, it was great. And <b title='without much activity or reaction'>low-key</b>, like I promised. No <b title='naughty (esp sexual) behavior'>hanky-panky</b>, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's nice.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.<br>
<i>Raj's Voice</i>Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one's my favorite.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, we're not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You ain't going anywhere, Threeway.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernadette, listen-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you've been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute, or Raj!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can <b title='[<a href="http://www.fightingarts.com/reading/article.php?id=152">link</a>]'>combat roll</b> into the street.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Don't you try and blame this on him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you, Bernadette.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i><b title='used to tell sb not to say anything about sth, or to tell them to be quiet. also zip your lip'>Zip it</b>, pervert!
<s>Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I'm not sure I even know who the man is any more.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm curious what's bothering you most, the <b title='almost reaching a particular level'>borderline</b> <b title='sex between people who are closely related in a family'>incest</b>, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Right. And that was...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>When I first met Howard, he seemed so <b title='knowing nothing of evil or wrong'>innocent</b> to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, if that's what you like, I'll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of 'em.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, a little. You hear stuff.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why didn't you tell me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to bedroom)<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't think that was helpful.
<s>The apartment. Howard is on the phone.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Hi, Bernie, it's me again. Please call me back.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, I am so sorry.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's not your fault, it's mine. I did all that stuff, not you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, you did do one of them together.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What is this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, but what is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken <b title='thin clear soup or broth; stock'>bouillon</b> in the cupboard when I moved in and it's been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, <b title='kill two birds with one stone'>two birds</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know what my next move is.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, Howard, I don't know much about women.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, uh, that, <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>that's it</b>. I don't know much about women. Raj, you got anything?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right. More Sailor Moon for me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I just threw up the bachelor party.
<s>Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Please come out, Bernadette. Let's talk through this.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, leave me alone.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hey, you introduced him to the <b title='sb who you think is dishonest or immoral'>sleazebag</b>. I'm just trying to clean up your mess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(At the door) Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I need to talk to Bernadette.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, well, could you at least give her a message?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, sure, I guess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Tell her I'm really sorry, and if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she's disgusted by, is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn't exist any more, he's gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, Howard. That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. And it came out of you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Penny has a message for you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother's, travels through walls.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do you want me to go?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No. Come here. (They hug) I'm still really mad at you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I get that.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Is there anything else about your past I should know?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I'll tell you later.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, is the wedding still on?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, the wedding's still on. (They hug again)<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, thank God. I'm still a maid of honor. (Joins in the hug)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)<br>
<i>Amy</i>This is kind of <b title='arousing'>hot</b>.
<s>The laundry room. Leonard enters in his <b title="=bathrobe, robe ↗pj's, pyjamas">dressing gown</b>.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's with the robe?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Taking it off) I'm gonna have s*x with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you're not.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, please.<br>
<i>Penny</i>If you wanna do something, you can help me fold this sheet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
