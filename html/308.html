Yeah, I'm going to be dining alone this evening, so I'll be reducing my usual order. I'd like to start with one quarter of the <b title='of various different types, mixed'>assorted</b> appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the <b title='a kind of cake/pie'>Golden Treasure</b> for two. Oh, for heaven's sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne.

<i>Sheldon</i>Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm back here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(At Penny's bedroom door) Penny. Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Shall I come back at a better time?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get in here! Hurry! Don't you dare knock.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for <b title='firm hold or grip'>purchase</b> on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tubs are slippery.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know. I slipped.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a series of <b title='unusual or strange and often amusing'>whimsical</b> duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They're holding umbrellas.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The ducks in my tub.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God. I <b title='(have) got to'>gotta</b> go to the emergency room.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, assuming you're correct that your right <b title='the large bone in the top part of the arm between the shoulder and the elbow 肱 (gōng) 骨'>humerus</b> is no longer seated in the <b title='a part of the shoulder [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity">Wiki</a>]'>glenoid socket</b>, I would certainly think so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, can you drive me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't drive.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I can't drive!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it seems we've reached an <b title='deadlock, stalemate'>impasse</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No no no, I can't wait that long, you gotta help me, please.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the <b title='plea - earnest request; appeal ↗plead'>pleas</b> of a <b title='girl; young unmarried woman'>damsel</b> in <b title='great suffering; the state of being in extreme danger and needing urgent help ↗agony, anguish'>distress</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No one's saying that. Let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it does seem rather ironic that <b title='for (the) want of - because of a lack of '>for want of</b> 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a <b title='burning or full of flames ↗fierce'>fiery</b> car crash.

<i>Leonard</i>I wish Penny didn't have to work, she loves camping.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, that would've been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard <b title='have sex with'>hump</b> a <b title='a desert plant with sharp points instead of leaves'>cactus</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but, just over Young ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who <b title='seem very clearly to have a particular quality. reek - stink'>reek of</b> desperation.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh I don't know, 50, 55.<br>

<i>Howard</i>I am.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, me too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look, they gave me homemade cookies.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course, they did. That's what grandmothers do.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, what are we waiting for?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Relax, I said we'd <b title='make a short visit somewhere'>stop by</b> a little later after they have their nap.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Good idea. They'll be <b title='feeling more lively and comfortable after you have rested, washed, eaten, etc ↗refreshments'>refreshed</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Cookie?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. Mmmm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mmm. Not bad.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not much to tell. They had a <b title='VW - Volkswagen [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2">Wiki</a>]'>VW Microbus</b> and were wearing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-dye">Wiki</a>]'>tie-dyed</b> <b title='an American rock band formed in 1965 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead">Wiki</a>]'>Grateful Dead</b> shirts.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>I see no organizational system in here <b title='used to emphasize a negative statement =whatever'>whatsoever</b>. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.<br>
<i>Penny</i>One was already in an accident.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That doesn't mean one won't be in another, especially if I'm driving.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Seriously? Those shorts with that top?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. (Picks up another one)<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. (another one) No (yet another one) Oh, that's cute.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We should have you checked for a <b title='injury to the brain caused by a blow, violent shaking, etc, resulting in temporary unconsciousness'>concussion</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, now, you gotta help me put these on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Penny</i>But don't look.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't look?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't want you to see me naked.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Well, that's understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is <b title='having existed for a long time'>well established</b> in heroic mythology. Uh, <b title='she became a pillar of salt after she looked back at Sodom [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot%27s_wife">Wiki</a>]'>Lot and his wife</b>, <b title='Gazing directly into her eyes would turn onlookers to stone.

<i>Penny</i>Yeah, great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They always look. It never ends well.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is that my arm?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It doesn't feel like an arm.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then, maybe you should let it go.<br>

<i>Howard</i>So, when do the meteors get here?<br>
<i>Raj</i>The meteors don't get here, the earth is moving into their path.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It's moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, how's that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Better. Thanks.<br>

Go back, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Where is the passenger side mirror?<br>
<i>Penny</i>In a parking lot in Hollywood. Okay, please go?<br>
