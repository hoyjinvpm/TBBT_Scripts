<i>Howard</i>Creepy good or creepy bad?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who was the shrimp with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster_sauce">Wiki</a>]'>lobster sauce</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That would be me. <b title='used to encourage sb/sth to approach. also come to daddy/mamma'>Come to papa</b>, you un-<b title='fulfilling the requirements of Jewish dietary law'>kosher</b> delight. (To Penny) I'm not necessarily talking to the food.<br>

<i>Penny</i>Why do you have-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, don't ask.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, don't, don't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll tell you why. I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I thought the blowers were more sanitary.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really, don't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hot-air blowers are <b title='incubator - a piece of equipment used to keep eggs or bacteria at the correct temperature for them to develop'>incubators</b> and <b title='spew - send out in a stream'>spewers</b> of bacteria and <b title='a disease that spreads quickly and kills a lot of people'>pestilence</b>. Frankly, it'd be more hygienic if they just had a plague-infested <b title='long-arm ape [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbon">Wiki</a>]'>gibbon</b> sneeze my hands dry.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, guys, I just got the most amazing new- (Sees Penny and can't pronunce the "s" of "news")<br>
<i>Penny</i>Gosh, Raj, do you think you'll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? (Raj shakes his head) Okay, well, I'll just um go eat by myself.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, you don't have to do that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it's okay. Between him not talking, (Points at Sheldon) him talking, (Points at Howard) and him, I'm <b title='be wiser to'>better off</b> alone. (To Raj, and hugs and kisses him) Goodbye, you poor, strange little man. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>She's so considerate.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, what's your news?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Remember that little object I spotted beyond the <b title='a region of the Solar System beyond the planets [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">Wiki</a>]'>Kuiper belt</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ Sub 17.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Or as I call it, Planet <b title='the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood">Wiki</a>]'>Bollywood</b>. Anyway, because of my discovery, <b title='an American celebrity news magazine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(American_magazine)">Wiki</a>]'>People Magazine</b> is naming me one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='congratulations'>Rajlations</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's incredible.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what to watch what?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thirty <b title='people who have clear ideas and strong feelings about the way sth should be in the future'>visionaries</b> under 30 years of age to watch as they challenge the <b title='opinions or ideas formed in advance and not based on experience or knowledge'>preconceptions</b> of the fields.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I had a million guesses, I never would've gotten that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's pretty cool. They've got me in with a guy who's doing something about hunger in lndonesia... and a psychotherapist who's using dolphins to <b title='help sb to live a healthy, useful, or active life again after they have been seriously ill or in prison'>rehabilitate</b> prisoners, and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Page">Wiki</a>]'>Ellen Page</b>, star of the charming independent film <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Juno</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I'd so <b title='have sex with her'>do her</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You'd do the dolphins.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do I get a honorable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist. He drives a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley">Wiki</a>]'>Bentley</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's a lease.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm confused. Was there some sort of peer-review committee to determine which scientists would be included?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Peer review? It's People Magazine. People picked me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What people?<br>
<i>Raj</i>The-the-the people from People.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their <b title='qualities, achievements, etc that make one suitable, qualifications'>credentials</b>? How are they qualified? What makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock <b title='traipse - walk around slowly and without a specific direction'>traipsing</b> around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment by someone under 30?<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, I bet Ellen Page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap. (Gets up angrily)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Sheldon) You proud of yourself?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In general, yes.

<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, there's my missing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino">Wiki</a>]'>neutrino</b>. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren't you, you little subatomic <b title='↗dick - penis'>dickens</b>?<br>

<i>Leonard</i>We're gonna apologize to Raj and invite him out to dinner.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Apologize? For what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, he came over last night with some pretty good news and we weren't very supportive.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I sense you're trying to tell me something.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You were a <b title='enormous'>colossal</b> <b title='jerk or idiot'>asshat</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was <b title='by a great amount'>by far</b> the most supportive.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Do tell.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the <b title='standard'>bar</b> for him? When I was 11, my sister bought our father a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug. And frankly, the man <b title='coast - to not try very hard to do sth well'>coasted</b> until the day he died.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, let's try it this way. What if this People Magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I had not considered that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mm-hm. Come on. (Motions him to leave)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I often forget other people have limitations. It's so sad.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He can feel sadness?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not really. It's what you and I would call <b title='↗condescend, contempt, patronize'>condescension</b>.
<s>Outside Raj's office.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Now, when we go in there, let's show Raj that we're happy for him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I'm not.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, then fake it. Look at me. I could be <b title='grind on - continue for an unpleasantly long time'>grinding on</b> the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount, he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic <b title='an unpleasant, unidentified substance ↗stuff, thingy'>schmutz</b>. But I'm <b title='big - generous'>bigger</b> than that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. What do you want me to do?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Smile. (Sheldon put on a big "smile")<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, crap, that's terrifying.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're here to see Koothrappali, not <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddler">Riddler</a>]'>kill Batman</b>.<br>

<i>Raj</i>Hey, guys. What's up?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.<br>

<i>Raj</i>It's very nice of you. I would like that.<br>

<i>Howard</i>Dr. Gablehauser.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Mr. Wolowitz. Boys, I've got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Actually, 2008-NQ sub-17 is a planetary body.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about me. You, my exotic young friend, are my star. (Goes over to him and rubs him on the shoulder)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But you didn't discover him. You merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008-NQ sub-17.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ugh. Sorry. ("Smiles")<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Boy, we gotta get you into a better office. Something more suited to your status.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really, you don't have to go to any trouble.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>How about I put you in von Gerlach's old office?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Done. (They shake hands)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait, I called <b title='a right to have sth'>dibs</b> on Fishbein's office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He gets a new office, I can't even get paper towels in the mens' room?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Damn, this is hard. ("Smiles" and glares at Leonard, and then "smiles")<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Let me ask you, what do you think the business of this place is?<br>
(Leonard and Howard whisper indistinctly)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Science?<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Money.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Told you.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>And this boy's picture in People Magazine......is gonna raise us a pile of money taller than (Pause) Well, taller than you. (Rubs Howard's head)<br>
<i>Howard</i>I have a Master's degree.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Who doesn't? Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the <b title='head of some colleges'>president</b>'s dining room?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I didn't even know there was a president's dining room.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>It's the same food as the cafeteria, only fresh. Come on, little buddy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, big buddy. See you tonight, guys. (They leave, holding each other)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can stop smiling now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah. (Rubs his cheeks)
<s>Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Raj</i>So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was <b title='whisk off - take sb away'>whisked off</b> to the People Magazine photo shoot- Have any of you was into a photo shoot?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-oh.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's fantastic. Apparently, the camera loves me, and I, it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this (Mimes "looking at the enormous universe") They're going to digitally add a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">Wiki</a>]'>supernova</b>. They say it's the perfect metaphor for my <b title='very bright'>incandescent</b> talent.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself. (Leonard nudges him)<br>
(Cell phone rings)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Howard</i>They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen, I have to go to the bank with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_cutter">Wiki</a>]'>wire cutters</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Smiles) Have we at this point met our social obligations?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Smiles) Not yet.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(On phone) Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can't go. Alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy. I don't know what I'd do without him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You just got him this afternoon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes, but I'm finding that having a <b title='footman or manservant'>lackey</b> suits me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A lackey?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In lndia, we just call them <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchable_%28social_system%29">Wiki</a>]'>untouchables</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Almost.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Speaking of untouchables, I've got great news for you guys. People Magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, gee, thanks.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, you're welcome. Of course, I couldn't get you into the VlP section......because, you know, that's for <b title='Very Important Person'>VlP</b>s, and you guys are just, you know, P's.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's a tribe in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea">Wiki</a>]'>Papua New Guinea</b> where when a hunter <b title='flaunt - show sth in order to gain the admiration of other people'>flaunts</b> his success to the rest of the village, they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense, of course, but one can see their point. ("Smiles")<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Brings him a Grasshopper) Here you go, Raj. You might wanna drink this one slowly.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay. So, Saturday night, can I count on my <b title='a group of friends who regularly hang out together ↗gang'>posse</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, okay. Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, uh... No I could, no.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can make it, but I won't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you guys talking about?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well there's a <b title='a large formal party to celebrate an event or to welcome sb'>reception</b> for my magazine article on Saturday.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You guys aren't going? I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment. You're not gonna be there to support him?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered was <b title='plummet - fall steeply or rapidly'>plummeting</b> toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That would be cool. I'd go to that reception.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, this is huge. Raj is gonna be in People Magazine and he didn't even have to <b title='make sb pregnant'>knock up</b> one of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears">Wiki</a>]'>the Spears sisters</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Would you like to go with me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course I would. I would be honored.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? Cool.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Shame on you guys.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Look at that, I got a date with Penny. (To Leonard) I can't believe it took you a whole year.<br>

(Upset) Of course, my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion-semen story (Pauses) What's your point?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame then perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better <b title=' friend, supporter, or associate'>cohort</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna breed a new friend?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's one option, but who has the time? But consider this. The Japanese, they're doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence. Now, you combine that with some <b title='technology that uses electronic systems to operate puppets'>animatronics</b> from the imagineers over at Disney.

<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but you're insane.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That may well be, but the fact is it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, the carriers of unusual <b title='sth that causes disease in your body'>pathogens</b>. And I'm not insane. My mother had me tested.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. You know, a guy who has your back.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And he should have a lot of money, live in a cool place down by the beach where we can throw parties.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He should share our love of technology.<br>

<i>Raj</i>Welcome to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>]'>Raj Mahal</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Very nice. Good night, Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No no wait, the evening's not over.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, it is.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, it's time to put on some <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Kelly">Wiki</a>]'>R. Kelly</b> and <b title='kiss'>suck face</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, wow, is the evening over. (Turns round and starts to leave)<br>
(Computer beeps)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wait, wait, wait. That's my mommy and daddy calling from lndia. I want you to meet my parents.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, meet them?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hello, Mommy and Daddy. Good to see you. How are you? I'm not drunk.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>Why would you say that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Just making conversation. Mommy, Daddy, I want you to meet my new <b title="primary focus of one's romantic life">squeeze</b>, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I am not your squeeze. (To Dr. and Ms. Koothrappali) There is no squeezing.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>I can 't see her. Center her in the frame.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Here you go. Cute, huh?<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>(Unhappily) She's not Indian.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>So she's not Indian. The boy's just <b title='go through a period of irresponsible pleasure-seeking while young'>sowing some wild oats</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing and no sucking face.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>What if he gets her pregnant? Is this little <b title='perfect'>hotsy-totsy</b> who you want as the mother of your grandchildren?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What right do you have to pick whom I have children with?<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Look, Rajesh, I understand you're in America. You want to try the "local cuisine." (Air quotes) But trust me, you don't want it for a steady diet.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Now, you listen to me. I am no longer a child and I will not be spoken to like one. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go throw up.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>What's wrong with him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. Maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you. Just gonna <b title='put'>set</b> you on down over here. (Sets down the laptop) And I'm gonna leave, so, <b title=' a customary greeting when individuals meet or farewell [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste">Wiki</a>]'>namaste</b>. (Leaves but comes back) And FYl, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>She's <b title='irritable, quarrelsome, energetic, forceful'>feisty</b>. I like that.
<s>Penny's apartment. Raj is pushing something under the door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Raj, what are you doing? No, no notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(In high-pitched voice) Sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sweetie, it's okay. (Hugs him)<br>
(Leonard sees them, and Raj puts his thumbs up. Leonard looks at Sheldon, who "smiles")<br>
