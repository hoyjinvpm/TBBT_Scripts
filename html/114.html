<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>This sandwich is an <b title='completely'>unmitigated</b> disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef, with lettuce and <b title='Swiss cheese'>Swiss</b> on whole wheat.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What did they give you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Turkey and roast beef with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat. (Everyone looks at him) It's the right ingredients, but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They <b title='used to say that the effect of an action or situation is the same as if it was another one ?è?...???ò'>might as well</b> have dragged this thing through a car wash. (Throws it back into the box)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Looking at his laptop) I don't believe it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. It's basic <b title='relating to cooking'>culinary</b> science.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Some guy is auctioning off a <b title='very small copy or model of sth'>miniature</b> time machine <b title='sth used by actors in a play or film'>prop</b> from the original film, and no one is bidding on it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A time machine from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>the movie the time machine</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. A time machine from <b title='a novel which depicts a mother faced with a forced decision in which all options have equally negative outcomes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice">Wiki</a>]'>Sophie's Choice</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Boy, Sophie could've used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it? It's <b title='simple and often not very well made'>rough</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, that's cool.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's only $800?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. That's my bid.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You bid $800?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was a <b title='sudden impulse'>spur-of-the-moment</b> thing. I <b title='thought'>figured</b> it would go for thousands, and I just wanted to be a part of it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do you have $800?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not to <b title='spend indiscriminately. An indiscriminate action is done without thinking about what harm it might cause'>blow</b> on a miniature time machine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, don't worry. The way these things work is people wait until the last second to bid, and then they <b title='arrive suddenly and do sth'>swoop in</b> and get it. It's called <b title='snipe - shoot from a hiding place'>sniping</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>15 seconds.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, snipers.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ten, nine, eight...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where are your snipers?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Five...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Snipe.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Four...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Snipe.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Three...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Snipe.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Two...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Snipe!<br>
<i>Raj</i>One...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw-aw!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Congratulations! You are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='a saying meaning sb has good fortune'>You lucky duck</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wonder why no one else bid. This is a classic piece of sci-fi movie <b title='things that you collect because they are connected with a person or organization in which you are interested ¨Jsouvenir'>memorabilia</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why don't we <b title='¨Jchip in'>share</b> it? We'll each put in 200 bucks, and we'll take turns having it in our house.<br>
<i>Raj</i>A time-share time machine. I'm in. Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Need you ask?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I still don't understand why no one else bid.<br>
[Time lapses. The guys are at the first floor, looking at the time machine. It's big.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I understand why no one else bid.
<s>Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Did the <b title='item'>listing</b> actually say "miniature"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I just <b title='¨Jtake sth for granted'>assumed</b>. Who sells a full-size time machine for $800?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In a <b title='a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of sets [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Wiki</a>]'>Venn diagram</b>, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets "no longer want my time machine" and "need $800."<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's actually a tremendous bargain. Even with shipping, it <b title='issue in a result'>works out</b> to less than four dollars a pound.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachysalambria_curvirostris">Wiki</a>]'>Cocktail shrimp</b> are $12.50.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How are we gonna get it upstairs?<br>
<i>Howard</i>If we take the dish off, it might fit in the elevator.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, but the elevator's been broken for two years.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've been meaning to ask you. Do you think we should make a call about that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not necessary. I have a <b title="a master's degree">master's</b> in engineering. I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover">Wiki</a>]'>Mars rover</b> started pulling to the left, I performed a <b title='...which affects the vehicle&#039;s straight-line stability [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_angle#Front_end_alignment">Wiki</a>]'>front-end alignment</b> from 62 million miles away. (Pushes the button) No. That baby's broken.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, guys! Push!<br>
<i>Howard</i>If I push any harder, I'm gonna give birth to my colon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go. Basic physics.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Raj</i>If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one. (In Western culture, the middle finger is an obscene hand gesture [<a target=_blank href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_the_finger  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_the_finger%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_the_finger">Wiki</a>])<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Comes out of her apartment) Oh. Hey, guys. (Leonard and Sheldon stand up and let go of the time machine)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Hi, Penny. (Raj and Howard scream) Take a break, guys.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're just, you know, moving something upstairs.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just... you know. Time machine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Okay. <b title='very good'>Neat</b>. But I really gotta get to work, so-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just give us a few minutes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't have a few minutes. I'm running really late.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then, I have a simple solution. Go up to thep roof. Hop over to the next building. There's a small gap, don't look down if you're <b title='vertigo - a feeling of sickness and dizziness caused by looking down from a high place ¨Jacrophobia, acro- - top, summit'>subject to vertigo</b> and use their <b title='the part of a building that contains the staircase'>stairwell</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're joking, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I never joke <b title='when dealing with/talking about'>when it comes to</b> vertigo.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Damn. (Looks at her watch) Okay, I'll just take the roof.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. (Penny is not amused) Time travel joke. It's not... never mind.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to suggest that what you are saying or referring to may not be very valuable or helpful'>For what it's worth</b>, I thought it was humorous.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let's just do this. You guys ready to push?<br>
<i>Raj</i>In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
<s>The living room. They're looking at the time machine thoughtfully.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era">Wiki</a>]'>Victorian England</b> into the post-<b title='Apocalypse - total destruction and end of the world'>apocalyptic</b> future, where society had <b title='splint - separate into smaller groups or parts'>splintered</b> into two factions: The <b title='underground'>subterranean</b> Morlocks, who survived by <b title='feast - eat (a lot)'>feasting</b> on the flesh of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Talk about your <b title='young woman'>chick</b> magnets.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, "I have a <b title='whirlpool bathtub/hot tub/spa [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacuzzi">Wiki</a>]'>Jacuzzi</b> on my balcony. I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony." But wait until I tell him, "I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedos">Wiki</a>]'>Speedos</b>, Jacuzzi Bob."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'll agree that <b title='the quality of being practical'>practicality</b> <b title='determine'>dictates</b> it remain here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You can't just keep it here. What if I meet a girl and say, "you wanna come up and see my time machine? It's at my friends' house." How lame is that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's got a point.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, I think we're going to need some <b title='basic principles'>ground rules</b>; in addition to the expected "no shoes in the time machine, " and "no eating in the time machine, " I propose we add "pants must be worn at all times in the time machine."<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='second - formally support a suggestion made by sb in a meeting'>Seconded</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was gonna put down a towel.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a <b title='"every two" or "twice a"'>bimonthly</b> basis.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, that sounds fair.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah <b title='wait'>hold on</b>, bimonthly is an ambiguous term. Do you mean move it every other month or twice a month?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Twice a month.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then no.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, every other month.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you can't be selfish. We all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.<br>
[Leonard turns it on; the lights come on. The guys gasp "Ohh"]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10, 1876.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and <b title='call out - summon'>calls out</b> for <b title='an assistant to Alexander Graham Bell, notably in the invention of the telephone in 1876. He is best known because his name was one of the first words spoken over the telephone. "Mr. Watson - Come here - I want to see you." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Watson">Wiki</a>]'>Dr. Watson</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait a minute. I'd want to see that, too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So when it's your turn, you can.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded. He'll know something's <b title='going on, happening'>up</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Also since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 <b title='a city in Los Angeles County, California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena, _California">Wiki</a>]'>Pasadena</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And even if he can <b title='succeed in getting somewhere'>make it</b> to Boston, what are you gonna do? Knock on the door and say to Mrs. Bell, "hey, Mrs. Bell. Big fan of your husband. Can I come in to watch him invent the telephone?"<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='Bell&#039;s father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell&#039;s life&#039;s work. Mabel Gardiner Hubbard was the daughter of Boston lawyer Gardiner Greene Hubbard, who was the first president of the Bell Telephone Company. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabel_Gardiner_Hubbard">Wiki</a>]'>Mrs. Bell was deaf</b>. She's not even gonna hear you knock.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a solution. First, go into the future and obtain a <b title='hiding'>cloaking</b> device.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, how far into the future?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I remember correctly, <b title='a fictional character in Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Kirk">Wiki</a>]'>Captain Kirk</b> will steal a cloaking device from the <b title='a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid species in Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulans">Wiki</a>]'>Romulans</b> on <b title='a fictional system of time measurement in Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardate">Wiki</a>]'>stardate</b> 5027.3, which would be January 10, 2328 by pre-<b title='The United Federation of Planets, usually referred to as "the Federation" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets">Wiki</a>]'>federation</b> <b title='reckon - calculate, think, guess'>reckoning</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10, 2328. Here we go, into the future. (Pulls a lever. The dish on the machine spins. Raj, Howard and Shelown mimic fast motion.) That was fun.<br>
<i>Raj</i>My turn!<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide. I slipped and skinned my knee.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you okay?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape, which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians">Wiki</a>]'>Armenian</b> family who insisted I stay for lunch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That doesn't sound too bad.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was eight <b title='course - one of the separate parts of a meal'>courses</b> of <b title='the meat of a young sheep ¨Jmutton'>lamb</b>, and they tried to fix me up with their son.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my <b title='a period of work time'>shift</b> away. Yeah, that's right. I lost an entire day's pay thanks to this. This...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Time machine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The lights flash and the dish spins. You wanna try it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No! I don't wanna try it! My god, you are grown men! How can you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that?! That...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Again. Time machine. (Leonard shakes his hand to mean "stop it")<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>, it's not a time machine.

<i>Sheldon</i>It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Pathetic! All of you! Completely pathetic! (Leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Happily) My turn. (Pushes Leonard away, who is clearly upset)<br>
[Time lapses. Leonard is sitting in the time machine, flicking the light switch.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because I wanna go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't. If you <b title='be to - used to talk about arrangements'>were to</b> prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it. <b title='therefore'>Ergo</b>, you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Same <b title='a statement containing two opposite ideas that make it seem impossible'>paradox</b>. If you were to travel back in time and, <b title='for example'>say</b>, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What if I knocked you unconscious right now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It won't change the past.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But it'd make the present so much nicer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you upset about something?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What was your first clue?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it was a number of things. First, the late <b title='point in time'>hour</b>. Then your <b title='the way sb look and behave'>demeanor</b> seems very low-energy, plus your irritability.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, I'm upset!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. I don't usually <b title='notice sth about the way sb is behaving or feeling'>pick up on</b> those things. <b title='used to show approval'>Good for</b> me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, good for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, wait. Did you wanna talk about what's bothering you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Maybe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wow. I'm <b title='good, performing well'>on fire</b> tonight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh... here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I disagree. Your inability to successfully <b title='try to persuade a woman to love you and marry you =court'>woo</b> Penny long <b title='happen or exist earlier in history than sth else'>predates</b> your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly <b title='happen in an independent way'>stands on its own</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks for pointing it out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got <b title='She played the character Weena. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Mimieux">Wiki</a>]'>Yvette Mimieux</b> with that <b title='used for emphasis'>very</b> time machine. In <b title='a 1985 American comic science fiction film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future">Wiki</a>]'>Back to the Future</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_mcfly">Wiki</a>]'>Marty McFly</b> got the opportunity to <b title='meet sb and become friendly with them, or start having a sexual relationship with sb'>hook up with</b> his extremely attractive young mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Those are movies.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to <b title='think of'>come up with</b> an example involving a real-life time machine? That's absurd.

<i>Leonard</i>Come on, guys, push!<br>
<i>Howard</i>If I push any harder, I'm gonna give birth to my colon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh hi, Penny. Take a break, guys!<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you know, just moving a time machine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Okay, neat, but I really gotta get to work, so-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No problem. (Takes his glasses off and throw them away; tears the tape off of the elevator; pulls the door open; stretches out his hand) <b title='grip firmly'>Hang on</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Lets him hold her waist) But... what about your time machine?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Some things are more important than toys.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Holds him by the neck) I'm scared.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't worry, baby. I've got you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Leonard. (Kisses him on the lip; they slowly go down)<br>
(Leonard wakes up to find him sitting in the time machine)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's still my turn.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm packing up all my <b title='objects that are valuable because people want to collect them'>collectibles</b> and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was that really necessary? If you need money, you can always sell blood. And <b title='↗sperm'>semen</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This is not about money.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We brought food!<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='salmon that has been smoked and is eaten raw'>Lox</b> and bagels, the breakfast of time-travelers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Terrific. Does anyone wanna buy my share of the time machine?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't want it anymore.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just... personal reasons.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spidey_Sense#Spider-sense">Wiki</a>]'>spidey sense</b> tells me this has something to do with Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, do you wanna <b title="buy out - buy sb's share of a business or property that you previously owned together">buy me out</b> or not?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half-owner and we'll put it on my balcony.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='let his balcony be screwed (fucked)'>Screw his balcony</b>. I'll give you 120 and we'll put it in my garage.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I paid $200 for my share.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, everybody knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the <b title='parking lot'>lot</b>. (They say that a new car loses half its value as soon as you drive it off the lot)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll <b title='bid'>go</b> for 200. That time machine stays right where it is.<br>
<i>Raj</i>300. and I'll throw in my original 1979 <b title='an American toy manufacturing company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel">Wiki</a>]'>Mattel</b> <b title='a fictional spacecraft in the Star Wars universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon">Wiki</a>]'>Millennium Falcon</b> with real light speed sound effects.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No more toys or <b title='toy models of people or imaginary beings'>action figures</b> or props or replicas or costumes or robots or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Wiki</a>]'>Darth Vader</b> voice changers. I'm getting rid of all of it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You can't do that. Look what you've created here. It's like <b title='nerd + vana ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>]'>nerdvana</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>More importantly, you have a Darth Vader voice changer?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not <b title='for a long time'>for long</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, I <b title='demand'>call</b> <b title='a right to have sth'>dibs</b> on <b title='The Golden Age of Comic Books [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books">Wiki</a>]'>The Golden Age</b> <b title='a name of a fictional comic book superhero [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_%28comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>Flash</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hang on. I need that to complete my <b title='a DC Comics superhero group [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_society_of_america">Wiki</a>]'>Justice Society of America</b> collection.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Too bad. I called dibs.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You can't just call dibs.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can and I did. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibs">Wiki</a>]'>Look up "dibs" in wikipedia</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Will you forget dibs?!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's the number? I'll <b title='give a sum of money that is equal to a sum given by sb else'>match</b> it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll match it plus a thousand rupees.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's the <b title='1 USD = 60.2113 INR [<a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=INR">Wiki</a>]'>exchange rate</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>None of your business. (To Leonard) Take or <b title='abandon, forsake'>leave</b> it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(On phone) Mom? My <b title='a ceremony that takes place on the 13th birthday of a Jewish boy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_mitzvah">Wiki</a>]'>Bar Mitzvah</b> bonds. How much do I got? Thanks. (Hangs up)<br>
<i>Howard</i>I can go $2, 600 and two trees in Israel.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Forget it, guys. If I sell to one of you, the other two are gonna be really mad at me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who cares? As long as you pick me!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, Leonard, put down the box. Let's talk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry, Raj. My mind is made up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Blocks the staircase) No! I can't let you do this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, get out of my way.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Draws a sword out of the box that Leonard is carrying) None shall pass!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. I did not wanna do this, but I have here the rare <b title='new and perfect condition'>mint condition</b> production error Star Trek the next generation <b title='Lieutenant Commander in Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge">Wiki</a>]'>Geordi La Forge</b>, without his <b title='a device used by the blind to artificially provide them with a sense of sight [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge">Wiki</a>]'>VISOR</b> in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, man. Be cool. We're all friends here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What the hell's going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Points the sword at her) You <b title='sb who pretends to have certain beliefs or opinions that they do not really have'>hypocrite</b>!<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Little Miss "Grown-ups don't play with toys." If I went into that apartment right now, would I not find <b title='a line of popular stuffed animals [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beanie_babies">Wiki</a>]'>Beanie Babies</b>? Are you not an <b title='accumulate - gradually get or gather'>accumulator</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_bear">Wiki</a>]'>Care Bears</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Ponies">Wiki</a>]'>My Little Ponies</b>? And who is that Japanese <b title='cat'>feline</b> I see <b title='frolic - play in a active happy way'>frolicking</b> on your shorts? Hello, Hello Kitty!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Okay, look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said. I was just upset.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I needed to hear it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, you didn't. Look, you are a great guy and it is the things you love that make you who you are.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I guess that makes me "large breasts."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff, and, you know, move on with my life.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Well, good for you. (Kisses him on the cheek)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks. Hey, do you wanna... I don't know, later...<br>
<i>Mike</i>(Comes up the staircase, to Raj and Howard) Excuse me. Hey, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi, Mike.<br>
<i>Mike</i>You ready to go?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I just have to change.<br>
<i>Mike</i>I'll give you a hand.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, stop it! Bye, guys. (They enter her apartment)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>My turn on the time machine!
<s>April, 28th, 802, 701.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked! (Some monters with yellow eyes appear) Oh, no! Not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! Help! Help! (Wakes up in the time machine)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, are you okay? We have to get rid of the time machine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it. Come on in, fellas.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Two monters enter; the back of their T-shirts reads "STARVING MORLOCKS") Oh, no. Morlocks! (Points at Leonard) Eat him. Eat him. (Wakes up in his bed) Leonard!
