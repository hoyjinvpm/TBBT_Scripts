<i>Penny</i>All right, thank you, and Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We don't eat here. I don't know what's good.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, it's all good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Statistically unlikely.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just get a hamburger. You like hamburgers.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers. You can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry. (To Penny) Give him a hamburger.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, which one? The <b title='A Gigantic Chop House Hamburger. Served with a Slice of Grilled Onion, Lettuce, Tomato and French Fries or Green Salad.'>Classic Burger</b>, the Ranch House Burger, the <b title='Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B. B.Q. Ranch Sauce.'>Barbecue Burger</b>, or the <b title='American Kobe Beef with Sautéed Mushrooms and Onions on a Toasted Brioche Bun. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. '>Kobe Burger</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can't we just go to <b title='a restaurant chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Boy_Restaurants">Wiki</a>]'>Big Boy</b>? They only have one burger... the Big Boy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, the Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would I <b title='accept sth even though it is not the best, or not what you really want'>settle for</b> something like a Big Boy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Because you're not at Big Boy!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Make it two.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(Approaches) Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Leslie.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I didn't know you ate here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We don't. This is a disturbing <b title='an action or event that is different from what usually happens or what someone usually does'>aberration</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leslie, uh, this is Penny. She lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And walks in quiet beauty like the night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, I've asked you not to do that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leslie and I do research together at the university.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, wow, a girl scientist.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yep, <b title='a funny/smart/cute/sexy design for any woman with a sense of humor'>come for the breasts, stay for the brains</b>. (To Leonard) So, I'm glad I ran into you. The Physics Department string<br>
<b title='four players/singers'>quartet</b> needs a new <b title='↗cello'>cellist</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What happened to Elliot Wong?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>He switched over to high-energy radiation research, had a little <b title='a small accident'>mishap</b>, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So are you in?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, sure, why not?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why at my place?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yeah, <b title='The United States Department of Energy (DOE) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy">Wiki</a>]'>Department of Energy</b> said our regular space is kind of a <b title='a location that is considered to be dangerous due to biological, chemical, or nuclear contamination'>hot zone</b>. (To Penny) Nice meeting you. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in <b title='a program in the United States and Canada, created by the College Board, which offers college-level curricula and examinations to high school students [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Placement">Wiki</a>]'>Advanced Placement</b> classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.<br>
<i>Howard</i>If you<b title='like'>'re into</b> music, I happen to be a human beatbox.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? (Howard plays music with his mouth) I'm actually not that into music. (To Leonard) So hey, your friend's really cute. Anything going on with you two?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Le-leslie? No, no. What, are you kidding?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He asked her out once. It was an embarrassing failure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm sorry. Was that supposed to be a secret?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw, that's too bad. You guys'd make a cute couple. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, dear.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Raj</i>She didn't take my order.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How can she take your order when you're too <b title='unreasonably anxious or afraid'>neurotic</b> to talk to her?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>What did Penny mean, "You'd make a cute couple?"<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I assume she meant the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one. As in, "Oh, look, Leonard and Leslie made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb. Aren't they adorable?"<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down, then it would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But, because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that she, Leslie, had turned me down, then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. "That's too bad, you would've made a cute couple..." but while thinking:"Good, Leonard remains available."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're a lucky man, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're talking to one of the three men in the western hemisphere capable of following that <b title='a related series of thoughts that are developing in your mind'>train of thought</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, what do you think?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I said I could follow it. I didn't say I care.
<s>The living room. The string quartet is rehearsing.</s>
<i>Leslie</i>I admire your fingering.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument. (He glances at her and she smiles. He glances again)<br>
[Time lapses]<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Good night, guys. Good job.<br>
<i>Guy</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Woman</i>See you next week.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was fun, Leslie. Thanks for including me.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>You're welcome. If you<b title='willing to do sth or interested in doing sth'>'re up for</b> it we could practice that middle section again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, sure, why not?<br>
<i>Leslie</i><b title='↗just so you know - I want you to know'>Just so we're clear</b>, you understand that me hanging back to practice with you is a <b title='excuse'>pretext</b> for letting you know that I'm sexually available. (Leonard suddenly stops, bumps into his music stand, and drops the sheet music)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yeah, I'm <b title='ready'>good to go</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought you weren't interested in me.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You mean my cello?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>No, I mean the obvious, <b title='vulgar'>crude</b>, <b title='a word/phrase that has two meanings'>double entendre</b>. I'm <b title='↗entice, tempt'>seducing</b> you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No kidding.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>What can I say? I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Gee. Uh...<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Is it the waitress?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny? What about her?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Well, I thought I saw your pupils <b title='become wider'>dilate</b> when you looked at her. Which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I did have a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy">Wiki</a>]'>poppy</b> seed bagel for breakfast. Which could give a positive urine test for <b title='opiate - drug containing opium'>opiates</b> but certainly not dilate my pupils. So I guess there was no point in bringing it up.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>You and the waitress then.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No... no. There's nothing going on between Penny and me.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>So you're open to a sexual relationship?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it is. It is good. Did you want to start now?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Why don't we finish this section first?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.<br>
(The beat gets faster and faster)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm g-good to go.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Me too.
<s>The hallway. Sheldon knocks at the door of Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, Sheldon. What's going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols. It's a branch of <b title='natural philosophy - an old word meaning natural science'>philosophy</b> related to linguistics.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaing yourself but you're really not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just come with me.<br>
[Leonard's bedroom door. A tie is hung on the doorknob. They hear music from behind the door.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What does it mean?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, you went to college.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but I was 11.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because, they're... you know, getting busy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?<br>
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into <b title='a Canadian singer-songwriter, musician, producer, actor, social activist, and photographer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Adams">Wiki</a>]'>Bryan Adams</b>.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(In a dry voice) Oh, Leonard, you <b title='very good/beautiful/impressive'>magnificent</b> beast.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We really shouldn't be standing here.<br>
[The living room.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is very awkward.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, <b title='the period of time during which a man and woman have a romantic relationship before marrying; the courtship of male and female animals is their behavior before they have sex'>courtship</b>, <b title='done before an event'>advance</b> notice... you know, last time, I was able to book a cruise to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic">Wiki</a>]'>Arctic</b> to see a solar <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse">Wiki</a>]'>eclipse</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wa-wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't have to. The dates just happened to coincide.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, do you know who's in there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, there's Leonard. And he's either with Leslie Winkle, (Picks up her violin case) or a <b title='Thompson SMG (submachine gun) 1930s Style Gangster Violin Case [<a href="http://www.pooshka.com/a.php?aid=4246">Buy it :-)</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_SMG  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_SMG%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_SMG">Wiki</a>]'>1930s gangster</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hmm, good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, good night. (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, wait, hold on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know what the <b title='a set of rules for the correct way to behave on formal occasions'>protocol</b> is here. Do I stay? Do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie. (Leaves)<br>
[Sheldon hesitates for a moment, and then goes over to his spot and sits down. He pulls out his cellphone and starts to dial.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On phone) Hi, Leonard? It's me, Sheldon... in the living room. I just... I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You-you carry on. <b title='[<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071226111112AAwva7K">link</a>]'>Give my best to Leslie</b>. (Hangs up and don't know what to do)

<i>Sheldon</i>(Wakes up) Big Boy... (Notices that someone is in the bathroom) Someone touched my board. Oh, God, my board! Leonard! Leonard!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, what's the matter?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My equations, someone's <b title='↗meddle, interfere'>tampered</b> with my equations.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course I'm sure. Look at the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function">Wiki</a>]'>beta function</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics">Wiki</a>]'>quantum chromodynamics</b>. The sign's been changed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you... hey, look. That fixes the problem I've been having.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(Comes out of the bathroom) You're welcome.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You did this?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water. So I fixed it and now you can show that <b title='A quark is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter.

<i>Leslie</i>(To Leonard) Listen, I gotta get to the lab. Thanks for a great night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. I'll see you at work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hold on. Hold on!<br>
<i>Leslie</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who told you you could touch my board?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>No one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I don't come into your house and touch your board.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>There are no incorrect equations on my board.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that is so... so...<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I'm sorry, I gotta run. If you <b title='discover'>come up with</b> an adjective, text me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Inconsiderate. That is the adjective, "inconsiderate." (Pulls out his cellphone and starts to text her)
<s>The hallway. Leonard are leaving.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can stare at your board all day, Sheldon. She's still going to be right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not staring, I'm <b title='maul - strongly criticize'>mauling</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Climbs up the stairs) Oh, hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So... how's it going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Pretty good.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just pretty good? I'd think you were doing very good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Pretty, very... there's really no objective scale for <b title='delineate - portray'>delineating</b> variations of "good." Why do you ask?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, a little bird told me that you and Leslie hooked up last night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm coming.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, is it serious? Do you like her?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't... Th-th-that's really two different questions. Uh, I'm not... Sheldon, we have to go!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Boy, you're <b title='stressed (wound like a clock spring) [<a href="http://www.italki.com/question/133656">link</a>]'>wound awfully tight</b> for a man who's just had sexual intercourse.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, well, I'll talk to you later, but I am so happy for you, Leonard. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. (To Sheldon) What did she mean she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone? Or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy? Because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy. Even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your <b title='sb who is involved in a casual sex [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booty_Call_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/booty-call  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/booty-call%27" tppabs="http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/booty-call">link</a>]'>booty call</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? I'm being ridiculous. Who cares what Penny thinks? Leslie is a terrific girl. She's attractive. We like each other. She's extremely intelligent...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's not that intelligent.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She fixed your equation.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She got lucky.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You don't believe in luck.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie. I'm not going to pass that up for some <b title='based on a situation that is not real, but that might happen'>hypothetical</b> future of happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy, with a woman who is currently making me happy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I still don't care.
<s>The lab.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Leslie.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Careful, Leonard. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen">Wiki</a>]'>Liquid nitrogen</b>, <b title='-160 °C Absolute zero is 273.15 °C or 459.67 °F. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a>]'>320 degrees below zero</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why are smashing a flash-frozen bana?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Because I got a bowl of <b title='an American brand of breakfast cereals [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerios">Wiki</a>]'>Cheerios</b> and I couldn't find a knife. (Picks up the banana pieces with a pair of tongs and puts them in a bowl)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So anyway... (Hugs her from behind) Hello.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Uh, what are you doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just... extending the intimacy. Hey, do you wanna <b title="go somewhere without attracting other people's attention">slip</b> over to the radiation lab and share a <b title='decontaminate - remove a dangerous substance from somewhere'>decontamination</b> shower?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists, but we both understand the biochemistry of sex. I mean, <b title='a hormone and neurotransmitter [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">Wiki</a>]'>dopamine</b> in our brains is released across <b title='A synapse is one of the points in the nervous system at which a signal passes from one nerve cell to another.'>synapses</b>, causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, who wouldn't?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Well, the only difference between us and the rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our <b title='a brain structure [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus">Wiki</a>]'>hypothalamus</b>. That's where you come in.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Well, I don't know about your <b title='the feeling of wanting or needing to have sex'>sex drive</b>, but I'm probably good till New Year's. (Starts to eat breakfast)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Okay. Thank you.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Thank you. You wanna make plans for New Year's?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Whoa, Leonard, please. You're <b title='smother - cause sb to die from lack of air'>smothering</b> me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Sorry. (Leaves)<br>

<i>Howard</i>Hey, look. It's Dr. <b title='young man, esp one who is thought to be very active sexually and is regarded as a good sexual partner'>Stud</b>!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Dr. What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>The <b title='made up of all blogs and their interconnections [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">Wiki</a>]'>blogosphere</b> is a buzzing with news of you and Leslie Winkle making <b title='Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major), K. 525, is a 1787 composition for a chamber ensemble by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

<i>Sheldon</i><b title='by a large distance'>Way</b> ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping <b title='a United States-based chain of buffet-style restaurants [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souplantation">Wiki</a>]'>Souplantation</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. The name always confused me anyway. Souplantation. You can't grow soup.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Approaches) So, how's everything?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mmm! Terrific. You'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Oh, yay!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um... I don't know... a psychiatrist? (Sheldon is stunned) (To Leonard) So, hey, how are things with you and Leslie?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Oh, that's too bad. Well, hey, don't worry. I'm sure there's someone out there who's just right for you. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did she mean by that?! Was that just a generic <b title='↗cliché'>platitude</b>, or was that a subtle <b title='offer; attempt'>bid</b> for attention?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker. This has a much more satisfying meat-to-<b title='a small round type of bread'>bun</b>-to-<b title='a substance such as salt, pepper, or mustard '>condiment</b> ratio.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you even listening to me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course, I'm listening. Blah, blah, hopeless Penny <b title='a false idea'>delusion</b>, blah, blah, blah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup.
