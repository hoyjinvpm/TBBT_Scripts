<i>Raj</i>Mm. Gentlemen, I <b title='express'>put</b> it to you: The worst <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca">Wiki</a>] This carries the poisonous substances with it out of the pulp...'>tapioca</b> pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>First off, that is <b title='axiomatic - obviously true and therefore not needing to be proved'>axiomatically</b> wrong because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a <b title='jiggle - move slightly up and down'>jiggling</b> bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no kidding.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='Dr. Fu Manchu is a fictional character introduced in a series of novels [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Manchu">Wiki</a>]'>Fu Manchu</b>, a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handlebar_moustache">Wiki</a>]'>handlebar</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil_moustache">Wiki</a>]'>pencil</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's extracted from the plant-<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not sure yet. You know, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney">Wiki</a>]'>George Clooney</b> has one now.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? I once saw him shopping at <b title='a major supermarket chain in the Southern California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralphs">Wiki</a>]'>Ralphs</b>. He was buying tequila.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow, you'd think a guy like that would have some kind of <b title='alcoholic drink ↗liquor, spirit'>booze</b> <b title='servant'>lackey</b>.<br>
(Sheldon's mouth twitches)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, this is cruel. We better let him finish before his head explodes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right. Sheldon, why is tapioca-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manihot_esculenta">Wiki</a>]'>Manihot esculenta</b>. Due to a high concentration of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide">Wiki</a>]'>cyanide</b>, it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly. (Drains his glass in one gulp)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Feel better now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's aslo <b title='native'>indigenous</b> to Brazil, as is the cocoa bean from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. You promised you wouldn't do that anymore.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Hey, Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Kripke.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Heard about your latest anti-proton decay experiment. Twenty thousand data runs and no statistically significant results. Very impressive.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What a jerk.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't feel bad, Leonard. Negative results are still results.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Even 20, 000 of them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right. Please don't cheer me up anymore.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, don't let him <b title='annoy/affect'>get to</b> you. It's Kripke.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, he's a <b title='huge'>ginormous</b> <b title='penis'>knob</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's why he eats by himself instead of sitting here at the cool table.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='for sure'>For shizzle</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hey, it's true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we <b title='take sth for granted - expect sth to be available all the time and forget that you are lucky to have it'>take for granted</b>. But he also controls the new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Science_Grid">Wiki</a>]'>Open Science Grid</b> computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Yeah? What would you say to the idea of you and I becoming friends?<br>
<i>Barry</i>I would say, I have no interest in becoming your friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? Oh, that seems rather shortsighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Aren't you take some time, to reconsider.<br>
<i>Barry</i>(Scoffs) Yeah, I'll do that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I think we're off to a terrific start.
<s>The living room. Leonard is fixing Penny's laptop.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. I mean, the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I got the same one. And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line. (Penny covers her face in her hands)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On phone) Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper. I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the <b title='a salad consisting of hard-boiled eggs; one or more varieties of meat, such as ham, turkey, chicken, or roast beef; tomatoes; cucumbers; and cheese; all placed upon a bed of tossed lettuce or other leaf vegetables. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_salad">Wiki</a>]'>chef's salad</b>. Apparently, you did not know that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I'm following up on our pending friendship. And I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper. (Hangs up)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's up with <b title='On account of both of her beauty and her father&#039;s wealth, which he is eager to inherit, Ichabod begins to court Katrina... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichabod_Crane">Wiki</a>]'>Ichabod</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, he's trying to make a new friend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, really? Well, good for him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, unless he makes one out of wood like <b title='the creator of Pinocchio [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Geppetto">Wiki</a>]'>Geppetto</b>, I don't think it's gonna happen.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, how did you guys become friends?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There was a flyer on the bulletin board at the university: "Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply."<br>
<i>Penny</i>And you moved in anyway?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I assumed he was joking. You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a <b title='unusual or strange and often amusing'>whimsical</b> side.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what about Howard and Rajesh? How did he become friends with them?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. How do carbon atoms form a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene_ring#Structure">Wiki</a>]'>Benzene ring</b>? Proximity and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron">Wiki</a>]'>valence electrons</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah, sure, when you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I suppose. I do miss whistling though.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on. Really?<br>
(Leonard whistles)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>First warning.
<s>Outside Penny's door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny. Penny. (She opens the door) This is for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hello, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a <b title='a written list of questions that are answered by a number of people so that information can be collected from the answers'>questionnaire</b> I devised. I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, well, that is a good question. But, is this really the best way to figure it out?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I agree. The social sciences are largely <b title='nonsense'>hokum</b>. But, <b title='without'>short of</b> putting <b title='electrode - a small metal object that allows electricity to flow through it'>electrodes</b> in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, question one: "Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal: Intelligence, <b title='never slackening or stopping'>ruthless</b> attention to hygiene, <b title='playful - funny and not serious'>playfulness</b>, <b title='a small application which is written in Java [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Wiki</a>]'>Java applet</b> writing"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You'd- An aspect of my most appealing trait: playfulness. Why don't you just go ahead rank that number one? I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than three hours.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, wait, how many questions are on this thing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Only 211. You don't worry. <b title='out of respect for'>In deference to</b> you I've kept them all at a high-school graduate reading level.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks, pal.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You got it, buddy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, honey, did you ever consider making friends by being... I don't know, pleasant?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tsk, tsk, tsk. Your questionnaire, very disappointing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I answered every question, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A-B-B-A-C, A-B-B-A-C.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you <b title='pick up on - identify/recognize'>picked up on</b> that, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, wait- How could I not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, uh, come on. There's over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. "Sheldon is to <b title='friendship and trust between people in a group'>camaraderie</b> as the space shuttle is to blank."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There are a number of acceptable answers. For example, C, near-Earth transport. But certainly not B, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado">Wiki</a>]'>avocado</b> rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I'd have better luck making friends if I wait till the <b title='a cybernetic civilization at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity in the Battlestar Galactica science fiction franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29">Wiki</a>]'>Cylons</b> <b title='take control'>take over</b>? Please.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold on. I put some real work into that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, well, it's better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon">Wiki</a>]'>raccoon</b> with what appears to be a <b title='swollen'>distended</b> <b title='that contains the testicles and is divided by a septum [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum">Wiki</a>]'>scrotum</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's kinda cute. (Sheldon glares at him) Uh, till you get to the scrotum.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. What hope do I have for establishing new relationships, given that my current friends apparently could not take a few hours out of their lives to help me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a <b title='having big testicles ↗nuts'>big-balled</b> raccoon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't see how you could.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ugh. What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, ahh, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the lnternet?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did learn how to swim.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>On the floor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The skills are transferable. I just have no interest in going in the water.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then why learn how to swim?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The ice caps are melting, Leonard. In the future, swimming isn't going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don't have to <b title='innovate'>break new ground</b> here. I'm sure much of the research already exists.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No, my point is if you wanna learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop, or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's insane <b title='judging by appearances'>on the face of</b> it. Come on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where are we going?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're driving me to the mall. I'm going to to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friend making.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
<s>The mall.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Reads the title of a book, which is held by a woman standing in front of him in the line) "Coping With the Death of a Loved One." My condolences.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Family or friend?<br>
<i>Woman</i>Family.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Too bad. If it'd been a friend, I'm available to fill the void. (The woman leaves) <b title='used to say that sth has happened in a good or fortunate way'>It's just as well</b>. She smelled like <b title='small balls of chemical pesticide [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothball">Wiki</a>]'>mothballs</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot <b title='a type of baked bread product [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel">Wiki</a>]'>pretzel</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To the clerk) Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?<br>
<i>Clerk</i>Um, yeah, but they're all for little kids.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I assume the skills can be <b title='extrapolate - guess or think about what might happen from information that is already known'>extrapolated</b> and transferred.<br>
<i>Clerk</i>Uh, I guess. They're right over there by the wooden train set.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! I love trains.<br>
<i>Clerk</i>I bet you do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Picks up a building block) Oh, my, that's awfully sticky. All right. Let's see. "Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now." That's probably about <b title='↗heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, straight'>homosexual</b> rabbits. "Gerry the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbil">Wiki</a>] ↗hamster, guinea pig'>Gerbil</b> and the Bullies on the Bus." Read it, not helpful. Ooh. Well, here we go. "Stu the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo">Wiki</a>] ↗parrot, budgerigar'>Cockatoo</b> is New at the Zoo." "Author Sarah Carpenter, lives in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Wayne">Wiki</a>]'>Fort Wayne, lndiana</b> (Sits down next to a little girl), with her husband and best friend, Mark, and their cockatoo, Stu." Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<i>Girl</i>I don't like birds. They scare me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Intrigued) Me too. Most people don't see it. What're you reading?<br>
<i>Girl</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curious_George">Wiki</a>]'>Curious George</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I do like monkeys.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Curious George is a monkey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Somewhat <b title='anthropomorphize - ascribe human characteristics to'>anthropomorphized</b>, but yes. (Leonard slowly approaches) Say, maybe sometime you and l could go see monkeys together. Would you like that?<br>
<i>Girl</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, what are you doing? I'm making friends with this little girl. What's your name?<br>
<i>Girl</i>Rebecca.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi, Rebecca. I'm your new friend, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, you're not. Let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I- (Leonard drags him away) We were really <b title='hit if off - get along well'>hitting it off</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't look up, there's cameras.

<i>Raj</i>I'm curious, in the "How Well Do You Know Sheldon?" section, what did you put for his favorite <b title='氨基酸 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid">Wiki</a>]'>amino acid</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard & Howard</i> (In unison) <b title='赖氨酸 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine">Wiki</a>]'>Lysine</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Damn it, I had lysine and changed it. (They enter the apartment)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good. You're just in time. I believe I've <b title='if you isolate an idea, problem etc, you consider it separately from other things that are connected with it'>isolated</b> the algorithm for making friends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, hear him out. If he's really onto something, we could open a booth at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_con">Wiki</a>]'>Comic-Con</b>, make a fortune.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You see, my initial approach to Kripke had the same deficiencies as those that <b title='plague - cause trouble/difficulty'>plagued</b> Stu the Cockatoo when he was new at the zoo. (Hands Raj the book)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Stu the Cockatoo?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. He's new at the zoo.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence into a simple flow chart that will guide me through the process.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Sighs) Have you thought about putting him in a <b title=' a large wooden box'>crate</b> while you're out of the apartment?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On phone) Hello, Kripke. Yeah, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Yeah, perhaps the two of us might share a meal together. (Points at a "Generic processing steps" block in the [<a target=_blank href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://soncp.com/tbbt/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_chart  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://soncp.com/tbbt/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_chart%27" tppabs="http://soncp.com/tbbt/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_chart">flowchart</a>]) Yeah, I see. (Follows a "Conditional or decision") Well, then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage? Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa. I see. No no no, wait. Don't hang up yet. But, what about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh, I'm sorry. I have no desire to get in the water till I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I can fix it. (Goes to modify the flowchart)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mm-hm. Mm-hm. It's interesting but isn't <b title='an act of stagecraft in which sb changes his or her voice so that it appears that the voice is coming from elsewhere [<a href="">Wiki</a>]'>ventriloquism</b> by definition a solo activity? Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours. Hmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? Yeah, what is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. (To Howard) A loop counter and an escape to the least <b title='unpleasant or offensive'>objectionable</b> activity. Howard, that's brilliant. I'm surprised you saw that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Back on phone) All right. That last interest strikes me as the least objectionable. And I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I'll pay. All right, goodbye. (Hangs up) All right. Time to learn rock climbing.
<s>A rock climbing gym.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This appears significantly more <b title='too large, too regular or without interesting differences'>monolithic</b> than it did on my laptop. No one expects to see <b title='homind - a primate of the family Hominidae, of which Homo sapiens is the only extant species'>hominids</b> learning to use bones as weapons.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Hey, you afraid of heights, Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hardly. A fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is <b title='sensible and careful'>prudent</b> and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to <b title='strengthen'>cement</b> our newfound friendship?<br>
<i>Barry</i>Come on, they have birthday parties here. Little kids climb this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Whispers) Little kid hominids, perhaps. (To the coach) So is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Let's go, Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Coming, Kripke. Okay, harness seems to be secure. A small amount of <b title='unable to control the passing of liquid or solid waste from your body'>incontinence</b> just now, but the website said that's to be expected. Hey. This isn't so bad. It's a bit like vertical swimming.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Hey, look at you, Cooper, you're almost halfway the top.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am? (Looks down) I- I was wrong. (Clutches the "cliff") It is a fear of heights.<br>
<i>Barry</i>You all right there, Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not really. I feel somewhat like an <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions">Wiki</a>] <img src="294px-Arctangent_Arccotangent.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Arctangent_Arccotangent.svg/294px-Arctangent_Arccotangent.svg.png">'>inverse tangent function</b> that's approaching an <b title='In analytic geometry, an asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity.

<i>Barry</i>Are you saying you're stuck?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What part of "inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote" did you not understand?<br>
<i>Barry</i>I understood all of it, I'm not a moron. Just keep going.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I don't think I can.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Well, then climb back down.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Looks down) No, that doesn't seem any more likely.<br>
<i>Barry</i>So what's the plan, Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it's not exactly a plan but I think I'm going to pass out (Passes out).

<i>Barry</i>Hello to you too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How was rock climbing?<br>
<i>Barry</i>He passed out. Just hung there like a big <b title='cured sausage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami">Wiki</a>]'>salami</b>. (Sits at the spot).<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Eh, eh, eh. That's where I sit.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of <b title='a crazy or strange person'>wacko</b> are you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>How much time you got?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You want some Chinese food?<br>
<i>Barry</i>Terrific. Got any dental floss?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>In the bathroom.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Be right back. I gotta floss Indian food out of my teeth if I'm gonna eat Chinese.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, are you okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes. I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's that?<br>

<i>Penny</i>Okay, you know what? I see where this is going. I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist, so just tell me what-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny Penny Penny, everything you're saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you're out. It's a good question. While you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

(Raj whispers something in Leonard's ear)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He had lysine but changed it.<br>

<i>Barry</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No? But we're friends.<br>
<i>Barry</i>I'm sorry. No, my friend.<br>

<i>Barry</i>No, that's wrong. There's an official schedule. I have no control over it.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>You gotta give him <b title='praise'>credit</b> for sticking with it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well I didn't think he had it in him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And he almost made it to the top this time. (Sheldon is hung on the rope, unconscious)
