<i>Leonard</i>Kites, ho!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Kites, ho!<br>
<i>Leonard, Howard, and Raj</i>Kites, ho!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. You're misusing the word "ho." It's an <b title='↗exclamation'>interjection</b> used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, "Land, ho!" Or, uh, "Westward, ho!"<br>
<i>Leonard, Howard, and Raj</i>Kites, ho!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys. <b title='what are you'>Whatcha</b> doing? <b title='The kite experiment was a scientific experiment proposed and later conducted by Benjamin Franklin with assistance from his son William Franklin. The experiment&#039;s purpose was to uncover then unknown facts about the nature of lightning and electricity. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_experiment">Wiki</a>]'>Going out to discover electricity</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not "discover electricity," he merely used a kite to determine that lightning "consists" of electricity. He also invented the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_stove">Wiki</a>]'>Franklin stove</b>, <b title='special glasses with an upper part made for seeing things that are far away, and a lower part made for reading. bi - two/twice/double'>bifocals</b> and the flexible urinary <b title='a thin tube that is put into your body to remove liquids'>catheter</b>. Kites, ho.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're <b title='head - move in a particular direction'>heading</b> out for some kite fighting.<br>
<i>Penny</i>"Kite ghting"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah. It's an extremely competitive, <b title='ruthless'>cut-throat</b> sport.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna come watch?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, sounds amazing. But, um, I've got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we're just gonna watch the Nebraska game.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, football, sure.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good guess.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I would've invited you, but I know you're not a football fan.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No,no, I'm not, so... great. You've got plans doing something you like, I've got plans doing something I like, so it's good.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, maybe we'll hang out later, you know, after everybody's gone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Kisses him) See ya.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, this <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, I got bored and <b title='drift off - gradually fall asleep'>drifted off</b>. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him from her friends because he's a tiny, little man who flies kites.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that certainly would suck.
<s>A park.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wolowitz is trying to <b title='move around the side of an enemy or opponent ↗flank'>outflank</b> us. Let out some string, add altitude and I'll go under and cut his line.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Focus, Leona, focus! The <b title='most intense/active stage'>heat</b> of battle is upon us. The <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dogs_of_war_%28phrase%29">Wiki</a>]'>dogs of war</b> are unleashed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe Koothrappali's right. Maybe I embarrass her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're embarrassing me right now. A grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry won't bring their kites down. Oh! String burn! String burn!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, they think we're flanking. They're playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two (A girl runs by) three<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you see that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>See what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That <b title='young woman'>chick</b>, she smiled at me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, she didn't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, she did.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, scissors, scissors!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hold my line. (Gives Raj his line and runs away)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you doing? I can't scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Victory!<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='used when you are annoyed or surprised'>Son of a bitch</b>.
<s>Leonard's car.</s>
<i>Raj</i>You're a <b title='of poor quality'>sucky</b> friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What was I supposed to do? She gave me that "<b title='intended to attract sb sexually ↗entice, seduce, seductively'>come-hither</b>" look.<br>
<i>Raj</i>If she gave you any look at all, it was a "you suck" look.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I would've caught up to her if I hadn't <b title='hammy - hamstring - a tendon behind your knee, which sometimes gets injured when you do sport'>pulled a hammy</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don't have a hammy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends. I embarrass her. What else could it be?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings because she's <b title='scout for - look for'>scouting for</b> a new mate and don't wanna do it in front of you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, how kind of her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Agreed. Most <b title='primate - a member of the group of mammals which includes humans, monkeys, and apes'>primates</b> don't show that sort of <b title='careful and sensitive behavior that does not upset or offend people'>discretion</b>. A female <b title='a species of chimpanzee [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo">Wiki</a>]'>bonobo</b> will <b title='have sex'>copulate</b> with a new male front of the old one without so much as a "how do you do?"<br>
<i>Raj</i>You always do this, you know? You <b title='abandon'>ditch</b> me for a woman you don't have a <b title='chance'>shot</b> with.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I totally had a shot.<br>
<i>Raj</i>With a woman you were chasing through a park. That's not a shot, that's a <b title='serious crime'>felony</b>. What's worse, it cost me my prized <b title='Fighter kites are known as patang in India.

Sheldon, I don't suppose there's any chance you could give me my kite back?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. I have your kite. I have your kite.

<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How was your football party?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It was pretty good. We won.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, wow. That's excellent. It's a weird <b title='an expression which uses words to mean sth different from their ordinary meaning ↗literally'>figure of speech</b>, isn't it "We won" when you weren't actually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don't say, "We defeated the Empire."<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm glad to hear it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, no. Why would you ask that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you know, I just noticed I haven't really met any of them.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure you have.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well... Yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller-yet-still-larger-than-me ex-boyfriend. By the way, were they here today?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course not.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I <b title='ramble - talk for a long time in a confused way ↗nag'>rambling</b>? Why don't you stop me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, look, if-if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn't want you to be bored.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wouldn't be bored. Why would I be bored?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, 'cause they're not genius scientists.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren't geniuses.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Like who?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses. My point is, if-if we're gonna be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, great. Well, then why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Another football game?<br>
<i>Penny</i>They have them every week.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did not know that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You wanted to meet my friends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. Sure, it just, I don't know much about football.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's okay, a lot of the guys' girlfries don't know football. They just kinda drink and talk in the kitchen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great.
<s>The living room. Raj and Leoanrd are wathcing a football game.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, a <b title='If a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is a complete pass (or an interception) only if a receiver catches the ball in bounds. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass">Wiki</a>]'>complete pass</b>. First <b title='A down begins with a snap or free kick (such as a kickoff or safety kick), and ends when the ball or the player in possession of it is declared down by an official, a team scores, or the ball or player in possession of it leaves the field of play.

<i>Raj</i>Really? The only thing I've learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without <b title='drug/medicine'>pharmaceutical</b> help.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Enters) Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me <b title='modify/upgrade'>pimp out</b> my <b title='an Italian brand of scooter [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa">Wiki</a>]'>Vespa</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm sorry, are you under the impression that we're still friends?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, come on. You're not still <b title='grind - continue for a long time'>grinding</b> on the kite thing, are you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don't have a shot with them.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I had a shot with that <b title='↗jogging'>jogger</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's not a little scooter. It's the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's no fooling you. Now, what is this <b title='a sack occurs when the quarterback (or another offensive player acting as a passer) is tackled behind the line of scrimmage before he can throw a forward pass [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack">Wiki</a>]'>sacks</b> statistic they <b title='display'>put up</b> there? (Grabs a book named "Football for Dummies")<br>
<i>Howard</i>All I know about <b title='Saks Fifth Avenue is an American luxury department store chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saks_Fifth_Avenue">Wiki</a>]'>Saks</b> is, my mother shops there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sacks, sacks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's football <b title='a system of naming things ↗term, jargon'>nomenclature</b> for when a quarterback is taced behind the line of scrimmage.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Scrimmage.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The line of scrimmage is the imaginary <b title='lying or placed across sth'>transverse</b> line separating the offense from the defense.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon knows football?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Apparently.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I mean, <b title='a fictional competitive sport in the Wizarding World of the Harry Potter universe [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch">Wiki</a>]'>Quidditch</b>, sure. But football?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I grew up in Texas. Football is <b title='seeming to be everywhere'>ubiquitous</b> in Texas: <b title='professional'>pro</b> football, college football, high school football, <b title='youth leagues'>Pee Wee</b> football. In fact, every form of football except the original, <b title='soccer ↗rugby'>European football</b>. Which most Texans believe to be a <b title='communist'>commie</b> <b title='secret plan'>plot</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Unbelievable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, you could teach me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Football or chicken-fried meats?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Football. I'm going to Penny's on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don't wanna look like an idiot. I wanna blend in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You wanna blend in with Penny's friends, I think looking like an idiot would be the perfect <b title='↗chameleon'>camouflage</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, Sheldon, please teach me football. It'll be fun.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's exactly what my father said. "Come to the games. watch the games." <b title='every week for a long time'>Week in and week out</b> from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Please, I'm asking you as a friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you making this a <b title='level'>tier</b> one friendship request?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I really appreciate this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, yeah. All right, <b title='nerd [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_the_Cat_%28TV_series%29#Poindexter">Wiki</a>]'>Poindexter</b>, sit down, shut up and listen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that's how my father always begin our football conversations. And if you'd like, after the game, I'll take you outside and teach you how shoot close enough to a raccoon that it <b title='crap - pass waste matter from your bowels'>craps</b> itself. (Picks up the book and then throw it away in contempt)
<s>The kitchen. Sheldon's meticulously toasting slices of bread, which come out with a Cyclon "printed" on one side.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Putting on a oversized football jersey) When are you gonna stop making <b title='The Cylons are a cybernetic civilization at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity in the Battlestar Galactica science fiction franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29">Wiki</a>]'>Cyclon</b> toast?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as <b title='Battlestar Galactica is an American science fiction franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>Galactica</b>. Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's wrong with a football jersey?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_dress">Wiki</a>]'>cocktail dress</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can't believe they had one for dogs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes. <b title='dog'>Canine</b> football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting <b title='clothes'>apparel</b>. My sister found that <b title='after a bad experience or by making mistakes'>out the hard way</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Anyway, wish me luck.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How would you put it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, okay, like you said.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for <b title='↗sexual intercourse, coitus'>intercourse</b>. Don't you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term "<b title='prostitute, whore, hooker ↗tramp'>ho</b>."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Goodbye, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah hold on. I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's funny about Cylon toast?
<s>Raj's apartment. Someone knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Raj</i>It's open.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Fawningly) Hey, pal.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I brought you a little gift. New kite.<br>
<i>Raj</i>The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty">Wiki</a>]'>Hello Kitty</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow, you just don't <b title='understand'>get</b> it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn't gonna make our problem just go away. (Throws the kite back)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look, I admit I haven't always been the best friend I could be.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You've been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='stipulate - state ↗stimulate, simulate'>Stipulated</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at <b title='an American franchise of electronics retail stores [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack">Wiki</a>]'>RadioShack</b>, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you're not even there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know, I know-<br>
<i>Raj</i>And where were you?<br>

It was like a free <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_dance">Wiki</a>]'>pole dance</b> right in the middle of the food court.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're <b title='behaving in a very unreasonable and annoying way'>impossible</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, at least I can talk to wome without being drunk.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me, I have selective <b title='↗mute'>mutism</b>, a recognized medical disorder. You're just a <b title="sb who is acting stupidly / a method of washing inside a woman's vagina using a stream of water ↗dork, doofus">douche</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. You know what? Maybe that's what this whole thing's about. You're not mad at me, you're mad at yourself.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, I'm mad at you. I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. You're mad at me. I get it. How about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We'll go anywhere you want.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on. Let me take you some place nice.<br>

<i>Raj</i>Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?
<s>Penny's living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Go! Go! Go! Go-go-go-go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sweetie, that's a <b title='best, most interesting or most exciting part of sth'>highlight</b> from the '98 championship game.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did not know that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How much beer have you had?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>None, why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. I was just kinda hoping you were drunk. Now we're back live.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.<br>
<i>Man #1</i>Oh, where's the flag? That's <b title=' a violation of the rules in which "a passer...throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_grounding">Wiki</a>]'>intentional grounding</b>.<br>
<i>Man #2</i>Totally.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of <b title='the number of yards that a team or player has moved forward'>yardage</b> or to <b title='save'>conserve</b> time. I can't believe they're not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here, have some pizza, sweetie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, you know I'm <b title='unable to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and to a lesser extent dairy products [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance">Wiki</a>]'>lactose intolerant</b>.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, come in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.<br>
<i>Penny</i>There's some in the fridge.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator. <b title='bread or cake that is stale is no longer fresh or good to eat ≠fresh'>Staleness</b> is caused by crystallization of the <b title='carbohydrate'>starch</b> molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.<br>
<i>Penny</i>On Earth, we say "thank you."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>You know. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis">Wiki</a>]'>Mimesis</b>. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell are you talking about?<br>

Have the <b title='native'>indigenous</b> <b title='all the animals living in an area or in a particular period of history ↗flora'>fauna</b> accepted you as one of their own? <b title="touch or push sb with one's elbow to draw his attention to sth">Nudge</b>, nudge, wink, wink.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I guess so.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite out for a test run.

<i>Leonard</i>I don't wanna fly kites, Sheldon. We're watching football here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, look at that. Oklahoma's coach is throwing down the red flag indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he's right, 'cause if he'not, it'll cost him one of his three <b title='time-out - a short break during a sports match when the teams can rest, get instructions from their manager etc'>time-outs</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I'll watch the end of the game. Besides, there's only three minutes left.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Until halftime.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This is just half? We've been here for hours.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And you're gonna be here for a couple more.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you're kidding me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nice meeting all of you. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend. He is really smart.
