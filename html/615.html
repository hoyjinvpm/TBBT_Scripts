<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would you say that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It's called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was a huge <b title="a message or report that is intended to ruin the surprising part of a popular film, book etc by telling people about the surprise before they see or read it">spoiler</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is wrong with you? If I did that, you'd <b title="complain, grumble">bitch</b> about it for weeks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, really, Leonard? Are you gonna have another one of your <b title="hissy fit - a sudden period of uncontrolled and childish anger =tantrum fit - sudden attack of illness ↗gig, number">hissy fits</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains <b title="a substance that is produced in a woman's ovaries that causes changes in her body and prepares it for having babies =oestrogen ↗testosterone">estrogen</b>-mimicking compounds. I think your morning <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_Puffs'>Wiki</a>]">Cocoa Puffs</b> are turning you into a hysterical woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are unbelievable. I don't know why I <b title="accept an unpleasant situation or person without complaining">put up with</b> you. You're controlling, you're irritating.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You're only proving my point, little lady.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What? I'm annoying? You criticize my behavior all the time. Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don't yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts 'cause you think they're ugly. You're impossible.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's it. I don't, I don't have to put up with this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw. Here's what I think of your roommate agreement. (Throws it on the floor)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You pick that up right now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't care. I don't have to do anything you say because I don't think I wanna live here anymore.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Crazy bastard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, wait.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
<s>Howard and Bernadette's apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Here you go.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Great. Come on in.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What, you don't say thank you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette's company going to Vegas?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, just me, her and a couple of the <b title="bigwig - important person ↗VIP">bigwigs</b>. It's part of a bonus she got.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not exactly. They spent <b title="a lot of">a ton of</b> money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is there a good anall leakage?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for <b title="↗laxative, diarrhea">constipation</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title="when life gives you lemons, make lemonade">Way to make lemonade</b>. You know, from <b title="near">around the corner</b> where <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge'>Wiki</a>]">fudge</b> is made.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I got a favor to ask.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Howard</i>My mom's been kind of an emotional <b title="sb who is very nervous, tired, or unhealthy ↗mess">wreck</b> since that dentist she was dating dumped her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dumped her? What, did he use a <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forklift_truck'>Wiki</a>]">forklift</b>? Sorry. There's nothing funny about <b title="relating to or caused by a disease">morbid</b> obesity.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She's huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she's doing okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, I'm a single man. Saturday night is my party night.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? What do you got going on?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the sidewalk for an hour until you break down and give the <b title="sb whose job is to make certain that no one causes trouble in a bar or club">bouncer</b> twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar <b title="a cocktail [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_%28cocktail%29'>Wiki</a>]">cosmopolitan</b>, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote <b title="a 2008 family comedy film [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Chihuahua'>Wiki</a>]">Beverly Hills Chihuahua</b>. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to <b title="a restaurant chain [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Callender%27s'>Wiki</a>]">Marie Callender's</b>, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What time should I be at your mother's?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I told her around seven.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>I swear, that man is the most <b title="thinking you are more important than other people and need not care about them, self-centered">egotistical</b>, insufferable human being I have ever met.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie'>Wiki</a>]">Burt and Ernie</b>. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I've had it. I am done. I can't, I can't live with him for one more minute.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow. So where are you gonna go?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was thinking here with you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That a problem?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, not at all. No, it's, it's great. It's terrific. I, you know, I just can't help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how's he gonna <b title="be able to live or deal with a situation with difficulty">get by</b> without you? Ernie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's got Amy now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, he does, but it's not the same.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn't abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron's sister?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Harry and Ginny get together?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I wanna live with you, I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his <b title="sb/sth that is blamed or punished for problems that are caused by sb/sth else">whipping boy</b>, his, his <b title="sb who is used by sb else to do things that are unpleasant or dishonest">stooge</b>, his <b title="sb who lets other people treat them badly and never complains">doormat</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you know what they say, <b title="if it ain't broke, don't fix it">if it ain't broke</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow. It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. No, no, I do. I do. It's just, I mean, it's a really big step.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is it? We're together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, um, Kind of a little thirsty. (Points at his drink)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I got nothing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. I'll go get my stuff.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, all right, don't freak out. You can make this work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, please let some of it be <b title="commonly used and FDA approved for the medical treatment of panic disorder, and anxiety disorders [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam'>Wiki</a>]">Xanax</b>.
<s>Mrs Wolowitz's house.</s>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Are you ready for dessert?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I'm going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I'm a fireman rescuing an infant.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Oh, please. You're a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I, I really couldn't. But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your <b title="meat (usu beef) cut from the breast of an animal">brisket</b> and hearing about the things you've had removed from your body over the years. Didn't know you could have a <b title="a lump containing liquid that grows under your skin or inside your body [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst'>Wiki</a>]">cyst</b> inside another cyst.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little <b title="If you ask for a doggie bag in a restaurant, you ask for any food you have not eaten to be put into a bag for you to take home. ↗takeaway, takeout, to go">doggie bag</b> together for you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>That would be lovely. Thank you. (Sound of crying) Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Don't mind me. I just cry when I'm lonely and have nothing to live for.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I'll make one.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>One vintage <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Mxyzptlk'>Wiki</a>]">Mr. Mxyzptlk</b> action figure. That's Leonard's.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Children's toy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That's Leonard's.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Children's toy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>One <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones'>Wiki</a>]">Game of Thrones</b> collector's edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That's a bit of an ethical <b title="puzzling problem">conundrum</b>. Eh, I'll keep it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>So, uh, what's your plan moving forward?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, suppose I'll have to find and <b title="If you cultivate a relationship, you make a special effort to establish and develop it, because you think it might be useful to you">cultivate</b> a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I <b title="take in - allow sb to stay in your house or your country">took him in</b>?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Like a dog-boy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Exactly.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Great. Here I am!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Here who is where?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...<br>
<i>Amy</i>Think about it, Sheldon. I'm not a stranger, we're intellectually compatible, I'm willing to <b title="serve as a driver for another">chauffeur</b> you around town, and your personality <b title="quirk - a strange or annoying habit">quirks</b>, which others find <b title="disgusting, loathsome, or repellent">abhorrent</b> or rage-inducing, I find <b title="very attractive">cute as a button</b>. What do you think?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...<br>
<i>Amy</i>Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...<br>
<i>Amy</i>See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little <b title="fight, argument, quarrel, scrap">dust-up</b> between you and me is much <b title="trouble; fuss; unnecessary activity">ado</b> about nothing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is that so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new <b title="not worrying or caring about the results of your actions">devil-may-care</b> bathroom policy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title="get to the point, leaving out all of the unnecessary details. [<a href='http://www.knowyourphrase.com/phrase-meanings/Cut-To-The-Chase.html'>origin</a>]">Cut to the chase</b>, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Amy's decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable <b title="mischievous child">scamp</b>. (Pats him on the head) That's a lot of product. (Rubs his hands on the pants)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey. What's going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Interesting.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, too late, pal. I'm not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn't that right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, if he doesn't wanna live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it without hurting her feelings.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a <b title="a peaceful public gathering focused on meditation, love, music, and/or use of psychedelic drugs [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love-in'>Wiki</a>]">love-in</b>? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn't <b title="prove that a statement or idea is not correct =rebut">refute</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That is the worst, isn't it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, Sheldon. I can't help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door's about to slam in your face.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um...
<s>Howard's old bedroom. A phone is ringing.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey. How'd it go last night with my mom?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, I guess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What time did you leave?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Actually, I'm still here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What? You spent the night?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of <b title="an American television drama series [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rockford_Files'>Wiki</a>]">Rockford Files</b>, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream <b title="a type of strong wine [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry'>Wiki</a>]">sherry</b>, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You wore my pyjamas?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, boy. Breakfast.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell <b title="blintz - a type of thin pancake [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blintz'>Wiki</a>]">blintzes</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>If you don't leave now, she'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, Howard, stop.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Trust me, you're not Jewish. That's how they get you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're being silly. I can leave whenever I want.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?<br>
<i>Raj</i>They're on the chair, right over- <b title="an exclamation of dismay or exasperation like 'woe is me' [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oy_vey'>Wiki</a>]">Oy vey</b>.

<i>Penny</i>Okay. Listen, the truth is I don't want him living with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I don't want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You think this is fast? It's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg <b title="short hairs">stubble</b> in my shower.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, and I've seen those legs. You might wanna get some <b title="a drain cleaner product manufactured by S. C. Johnson & Son. [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drano'>Wiki</a>]">Drano</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hold on. If you don't wanna live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you know how he is. He's sensitive and emotional.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's because he drinks too much soy milk.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I don't know what else we can do but tell them the truth.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.

<i>Howard</i>Here's some more ice.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, thanks.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Those Chinese acrobats in <b title="'Circus of the Sun' is a Canadian entertainment company [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil'>Wiki</a>]">Cirque du Soleil</b> made it look so easy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favor. (Phone rings)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Raj. What's up?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You were right. I can't get out of here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're still at my mother's?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, Howard, help me.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Rajesh, <b title="little father">tatelah</b>, I ran you a bath.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, my God. She's not gonna bathe me, is she?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But, Howard-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Should we go back and rescue him?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's too late. We'll see him at his <b title="Jewish coming of age rituals [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah'>Wiki</a>]">Bar Mitzvah</b>.

<i>Amy</i>Yes.<br>

<i>Amy</i>Yes. I did good, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, why would you?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, and, uh, check this out. I <b title="take the liberty of - do sth without permission">took the liberty of</b> scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello. This is Sheldon.<br>
<i>Amy</i>And this is Amy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We're not home right now.<br>
<i>Amy</i>'Cause we out <b title="drop science - share knowledge/information">dropping science</b>, <b title="friend, dude">son</b>.<br>
<i>Together</i>Leave a message.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Beep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't live here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn't break in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. It's not the message.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You did.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your <b title="stupid">dopey</b> space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip <b title="a substance you put on sth to make it shine">gloss</b> 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you're ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can't live here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's Penny's fault.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She doesn't wanna live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She's the snake in our garden. She's the reason we can't be happy.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Ames.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can't 'cause you don't wanna live with Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Off) What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, what did you say?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I said the truth. You don't wanna live with Leonard, and you know it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Since when don't you wanna live with me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, don't get all <b title="angry and upset">huffy</b>. You're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I think we should talk about that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And since you love the truth so much, why don't you tell Amy you don't wanna live with her instead of blaming it on me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I thought we were talking about the other thing.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You're a coward.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, the evidence does support that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, Amy, let's go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you wanna catch up on some <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_Dead'>Wiki</a>]">Walking Dead</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>'Kay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you seen the one where Lori dies?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Or maybe she doesn't. Let's find out.
