<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, look. <b title='a 1980 British science fiction thriller film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_3">Wiki</a>]'>Saturn 3</b> is on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't wanna watch Saturn 3. <b title='a 1993–1999 television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine">Wiki</a>]'>Deep Space Nine</b> is better.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Compromise. Watch <b title='an American space opera television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Wiki</a>]'>Babylon 5</b>. (Chuckles)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In what sense is that a compromise?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, five is partway between three- Never mind.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll tell you what. How about we go Rock-paper-scissors?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ooh, I don't think so. <b title="based on sb's personal experience or information rather than on facts that can be checked">Anecdotal</b> evidence suggests that in a game of Rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 percent of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock">Wiki</a>]'>Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors <b title='cut off head ↗behead'>decapitates</b> lizard, lizard eats paper, paper <b title='prove to be false or wrong'>disproves</b> Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, I think I got it.<br>
<i>Raj and Sheldon</i>Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. (Both reveal paper) Oh....<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Dressed grotesquely) Hello, boys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='used by people in boats to attract attention'>Ahoy</b>, <b title='used by men as a very informal or disrespectful way of speaking to another man'>matey</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Noticed the eye patch, did you? It's all part of a technique I've been studying for <b title='pick up - successfully attract'>picking up</b> women. You <b title='use'>employ</b> a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes, like the male peacock with brilliant <b title='feathers'>plumage</b> or the <b title='in a time of sexual activity'>rutting</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baboon">Wiki</a>] ↗ape, gorilla, chimpanzee, orang-utan, gibbon'>baboon</b> with <b title='swollen and full of liquid'>engorged</b> <b title='the back part of an animal that has four legs'>hindquarters</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Or in this case, the <b title='when Jewish boys become 13 years old, they become accountable for their actions and become a bar mitzvah. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_mitzvah">Wiki</a>]'>bar mitzvah</b> boy with a <b title='conjunctivitis - inflammation of the thin transparent membrane which covers the eyeball'>pink eye</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in or something distinctive, <b title='look at sb/sth to see what they are like'>scope out</b> your target and toss out some negs.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are negs?<br>
<i>Howard</i>A neg is a negative compliment that <b title='make her be not able to play as well as normal'>throws a pretty woman off her game</b>, like: "Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth, but on you they work." I got a whole list of them. Who wants to be my <b title='A pilot whose plane is positioned behind and outside the leader in a formation of flying aircraft'>wingman</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're not gonna need a wingman. You're gonna need a <b title='ambulance man'>paramedic</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, your scooter's blocking my car. Oh, did you get pink eye again?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Step one: she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Stretches his eye patch and then let it go) Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the <b title='a large steel waste container for garbage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster">Wiki</a>]'>Dumpster</b>. (Slams her door)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ow.
<s>Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars#Animation">Wiki</a>]'>Clone Wars TV series</b> until I've seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas">Wiki</a>]'>George Lucas</b> disappoint me in the order he intended.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I wanna watch it now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then I believe we've arrived at another <b title='typical ↗quite, essential'>quintessential</b> Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock moment. (Reachs out his hand)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Watch whatever you want. (Hands him the remote)<br>
<i>Raj</i>I saw what you did there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What'd I do?<br>
(Phone rings)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello? Hey, Howard. What's wrong? Uh, okay. Okay, we'll be right there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard's at the <b title='an automated motor vehicle which propels itself across the surface of the planet Mars upon arrival [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover">Wiki</a>]'>Mars rover</b> lab. He says he's in trouble. <b title='an alert state used by the United States Armed Forces [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defcon">Wiki</a>]'>DEFCON</b> 5.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>DEFCON 5? Well, there's no need to rush.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>DEFCON 5 means no danger. DEFCON 1 is a crisis.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How can five not be worse than one?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_V">Wiki</a>]'>Star Trek</b> V, worse than I.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alright, first of all, that's a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is <b title='powers of 10'>orders of magnitude</b> worse than Star Trek V.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction while Star Trek I fails across the board. Art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? Can we just forget I said " DEFCON" and go?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Star Trek V.
<s>Hallway outside the lab.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alright, will you at least <b title='state'>stipulate</b> that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I have three words for you: <b title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'>Wrath of Khan</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh thank God you're here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the emergency?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I got the Mars rover stuck in a <b title='↗trench, crevice'>ditch</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where?<br>
<i>Howard</i>On a dusty highway just outside <b title=' a city near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley in Kern County, California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield">Wiki</a>]'>Bakersfield</b>. Where do you think? On Mars.<br>
(The door opens and a girl appears)<br>
<i>Girl</i>Howard, is everything okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You brought a girl to the Mars rover control room?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor. One free <b title='a medical procedure used to examine and diagnose problems with the human colon (large intestine) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_enema">Wiki</a>]'>barium enema</b> and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait-wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, there were three other guys with eye patches. It was a <b title='diaster ↗catastrophe'>fiasco</b>. What did work was: "How'd you like to visit a secret government facility?"<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, what exactly do you want us to do?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I need you and Raj to help me get the rover out of the ditch, (To Leonard) and need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she is here. She doesn't exactly have <b title=' official permission for sb to work with secret information etc'>clearance</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? They don't let strange women from <b title='cheap, noisy bar or dance hall'>honky-tonks</b> come in to play with $200 million government projects on distant planets?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me. Can we please move on?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Hey, Howard, you know, it's getting late, so, do I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> drive this thing or what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, no, I'm sorry, but something<b title='has happened'>'s come up</b>. Kind of a Mars rover- Mars-rover-can-Howard-come-over... situation. So, my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll call you.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Yeah. So, are you a scientist like Howard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No one's a scientist like Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>My mother is so gonna love her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How nice. Maybe they can <b title='travel together ↗share a cab, pitch in'>carpool</b> when they visit you in federal prison.
<s>Leonard's car. Stephanie's kissing him passionately.</s>
<i>Stephanie</i>I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you. What-what-what were you saying?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just said Howard's a terrific guy.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Yeah. (Resumes the kiss)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's got a great sense of humor. He loves his mother... a lot. Some people say too much.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>I really like that you're such a loyal friend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at <b title='the situation as a whole'>the big picture</b>. Just, uh, out of curiosity, did he ever have a <b title='chance'>shot</b> with you?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So then why did you-<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>He said that I could drive a car on Mars.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, can I see you again?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>You're not done seeing me now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Cool.
<s>The control room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Anything?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the rover is not responding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of <b title='faces'>excrement</b> and a <b title='canoe'>Native American water vessel</b> without any means of <b title='↗propeller, hand-driven'>propulsion</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hang on, there's gotta be other options.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You try calling <b title='From the standpoint of the consumer, AAA (American Automobile Association) clubs primarily provide emergency road services to members. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Automobile_Association">Wiki</a>]'>AAA</b>. But based on NASA's latest timetable, they won't get there for 35 years.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Plus, I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, <b title='a general exclamation'>snap</b>. (Chuckles)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Snap what?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I guess we have to turn to plan B.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's plan B?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Erase all the hard drives, grab the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why wasn't that plan A?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Announcer on TV</i>A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data, they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars rover's malfunction. This is not... mission to Mars since any...<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank God for plan B.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, didn' t you say you worked on the Mars rover?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, you're mistaken.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, when we first met. You said that if I went out with you I could drive a car on Mars.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know what you're talking about.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Psst? (Motions Sheldon to come with him)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Will you all excuse me? Leonard is suddenly signaling that he'd like to talk to me in private.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. Yeah, I remember <b title='in a detailed or exact way'>specifically</b>. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, that <b title='used for emphasis'>does</b> sound like me, but no.<br>
[Leonard's bedroom]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is there some problem?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, um, listen, I have to kind of sneak out for a while.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Goodbye.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, wait. If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't tell you that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, who would ask me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't tell you that either.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So you brought me here to inform me that you can't tell me where you're going. And you can't tell me who might ask?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I really didn't think this through.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, a moment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If someone, and of course we don't know who this would be, does ask where you've gone, what should I say?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Just tell them I went to the office.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you going to the office?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, how can I say it convincingly?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just say, "Leonard went to the office."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Leonard went to the-the office.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is-? No, not like that. Just "Leonard went to the office."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It would have worked a lot better if you just told me you were going to the office.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm going to the office.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>See, why don't I believe you?<br>
[Back to the living room]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm going out for a while.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Doesn't anyone wanna know where he's going?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, where is he going?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard is going to, the office.
<s>Stephanie's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So how was work today?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Busy. I removed an appendix, a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder">Wiki</a>]'>gallbladder</b> and about a foot and a half of bowel.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm hoping that was three different guys. (Chuckles)<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>(not amused) No, just the one. He didn't make it. So, how was your day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, I'm a physicist, so I thought about stuff.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>That's it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wrote some of them down.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Are you done eating?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Oh, good. (Kisses him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If I knew you were waiting, I would have swallowed that lasagna whole.<br>
(Phone rings)<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>(On answering machine) You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Steph, it's me again, Howard. Listen, if you're free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a <b title='a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket">Wiki</a>]'>brisket</b>. Let me know. It's Howard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Mm-hm.<br>
[Continued from earlier]<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Maybe, we should think about going to the bedroom.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's a good idea, 'cause there's a bed there, and I'm very, very, very <b title='in favor of'>pro-</b>bed.<br>
(Phone rings)<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, it's me again. Just wanna let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from <b title='a desert resort city in Riverside County, California, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs">Wiki</a>]'>Palm Springs</b>. Oh, and if anybody <b title='used to talk about sth that may possibly happen or be true'>should</b> ask, you're half Jewish on your mother's side. Okay, call me. It's Howard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't you think, you should tell him you're not interested?
<s>The bedroom.</s>
<i>Stephanie</i>(Muffled) You want me to stop and call him back right now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Dear God, no.<br>
(Phone rings)<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, it's me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from <b title='a city in the U. S. state of Florida [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale">Wiki</a>]'>Fort Lauderdale</b> are flying in to meet you so that means we 're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>(Shouting over phone) Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden. I have a coupon from the paper.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're not going to the Olive Garden, Ma.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Oh, Mr. <b title='important person'>Big Shot</b> with his red lobster.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll call you back when we <b title='make arrangements more final and fixed'>firm up</b> the details. It's Howard.
<s>The landuary room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>New shirts?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, a couple.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, who's the girl?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what we did was in fact dating?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah, we did have a date.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, who is she?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, she's a doctor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, nice. A "doctor" doctor, or a your kind a doctor?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>"Doctor" doctor. Surgical <b title='a doctor working at a hospital where he or she is being trained'>resident</b>. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he's dating someone but he's not, because in fact, you're dating her, does that make you a bad person?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, that depends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>On what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is that friend Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='take advantage of, ruin, fuck'>Screw</b> him, you're fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, have you slept with her yet? (Leonard smirks) You <b title="sometimes said admiringly, in particular regarding a man's sexual exploits">dog</b>. (Pushes him on the chest playfully) Good for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Does that change things?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, why'd you ask?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm <b title='inquisitive'>nosy</b>. See you.
<s>Howard's house. Leonard knocks at the door.</s>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, get the door!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you, I had no idea! (In normal tone) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's Leonard!<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>You're gonna have to play outside! I'm not dressed to <b title='welcome/entertain guests'>receive</b>!<br>
<i>Howard</i>No one cares, Ma! (In normal tone) So, what's up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Listen, I need to talk to you about something.<br>
(Cell phone rings)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Momentito. Yello? Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried. Oh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. No, I understand. Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.
<s>The living room. Leonard isn't there.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?<br>
<i>Alll</i>Rock Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. (Tie)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, one of us is going to have to stop <b title='put up - raise'>putting up</b> Spock.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How do we decide that?<br>
<i>Alll</i>Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. (All grunt)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Howard. Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard is employing a schoolyard <b title='model'>paradigm</b> in which you are <b title='in every practical sense / under most usual circumstances'>for all intents and purposes</b> <b title='dead'>deceased</b>. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, <b title='feign - pretend'>feigning</b> an inability to hear you when you speak, and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't make the rules, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did someone just feel a cold breeze?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is a so-called <b title='ectoplasm - a substance which is believed to surround ghosts'>ectoplasmic</b> issue of a <b title='existing without a body or separated from a body'>disembodied</b> soul passing by.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, <b title='exclamation of abandon'>screw it</b>. I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.<br>
(knocking on door)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi, Steph.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on in.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Oh, is this a bad time?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so...<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead-To-Me.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Hello, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He just won't listen to me.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Okay, well, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm. Lisa's gonna be disappointed.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Lisa?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup. And I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive. It's a miracle. (Hugs them)
<s>The kitchen.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I'm sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday, my mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, Howard. Look at this.<br>
(Man speaking indistinctly on TV)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Anyway, call me. It's Howard.<br>
<i>Announcer on TV</i>It's unclear how the Mars rover got into the <b title='a narrow crack'>crevice</b>, but one thing's certain: The data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars.
