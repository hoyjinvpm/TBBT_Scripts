<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those <b title='relating to the penis'>penile</b> enlargement pills do not work.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's amazing. You'll be like his <b title='In motorsports, a pit stop is where a racing vehicle stops in the pits during a race for refuelling, new tires, repairs, mechanical adjustments, a driver change, or any combination of the above. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop">Wiki</a>]'>pit crew</b>. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking <b title='funny imitation'>impression</b> in front of him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(In Stephen Hawking voice) You're right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, boy, Sheldon's going to freak out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, he worships Hawking.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's really nice of you, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hm, it's no big deal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Boy, a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order">Wiki</a>]'>restraining order</b> from Stephen Hawking. It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from <b title=' an American actor, film director, poet, singer, and photographer. Nimoy is best known for his role as Spock in the original Star Trek series (1966–69) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy">Wiki</a>]'>Leonard Nimoy</b>, <b title='an American astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, science popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Wiki</a>]'>Carl Sagan</b> and <b title='an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, media producer, television host, actor, voice actor and former president and chairman of Marvel Comics. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">Wiki</a>]'>Stan Lee</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding of the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Wiki</a>]'>Higgs boson particle</b>, and you said, Sheldon, it's two a.m., get out of my bedroom?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I believe I've done it. And I'm only saying believe to sound modest, because, <b title='similar to "sweet Jesus" because Sheldon is from Texas and Houston, Texas is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Houston">Sam Houston</a>'>sweet Sam Houston</b>, I did it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's incredible. Oh, here, <b title='bring out'>break out</b> the math.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so, this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking- Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn't gonna make any sense to you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Still going to introduce him?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not on your life.
<s>A corridor.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I told you, no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I said I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, you said, would it help if I said I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, you're a <b title='behaving as though you think you are better, more intelligent, or more important than other people ↗arrogant, contempt'>condescending</b> jerk. Why on earth would I wanna do something nice for you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Um, to go to Jewish heaven?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Jews don't have heaven.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then to avoid Jewish hell?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you can't be serious.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there's another human being.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, okay, I can see you're gonna take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but <b title='chimp - chimpanzee ↗ape, gibbon, primate, orang-utan, gorilla'>chimps</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Get out of my lab.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, now they're so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Get out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How about dolphins?
<i>Howard</i>Out!
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It was great. We talked about movies.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I showed him some card tricks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Howard</i>He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Something got you down there, <b title='[<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bunky">link</a>]'>bunky</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, please, I'm begging you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj, you're our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Parade">Wiki</a>]'>Rose Bowl Parade</b>, he begged a deity he doesn't believe in to end his life quickly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, sir, no, I took my dad's desk chair, attached a <b title='a series of electronic handheld child computers [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_%28toy%29">Wiki</a>]'>Speak & Spell</b> to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. <b title='used when you admit that sth is true'>Granted</b> most people thought I was <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2">Wiki</a>]'>R2-D2</b>, but still, I got a lot of candy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You don't seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, 不. Japanese, いいえ. Klingon, qo. Binary coded <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">Wiki</a>]'>ASCII</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp">converter</a>]'>01101110 01101111</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's actually 011 0111.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not asking for me, I'm asking for Hawking.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let me try <b title='of or relating to the music, clothing, and culture of street gangs'>gansta</b>, hells no.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, look, how about this? You just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made, he'll <b title='show people that you are interested in them and want to listen to them'>reach out to</b> me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What if he doesn't?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He will, he's really smart.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's an interesting idea. Why don't you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How do I do that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You walk away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Walking away.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You do realize you own <b title='him'>his ass</b> right now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You can make him do anything you want.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I know, I'm just trying to figure out how much I wanna punish him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, don't be too mean.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hey, fellas, I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I wouldn't mind a glass.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wasn't talking to you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Bring him to his bony knees.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, come on back.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, yes. What did you decide?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great, thank you. Oh, that's terrific.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What kinds of things?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Are you familiar with the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules">Wiki</a>]'>12 labors of Hercules</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You should be so lucky.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. What would you like me to do first?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I thought I'd start you off by polishing my belt buckles.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my <b title="Sheldon's nickname for his maternal grandmother">meemaw</b>'s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_dog">Wiki</a>]'>prairie dog</b> with a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce_boat">Wiki</a>]'>gravy boat</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's nice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's a lot of belt buckles.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I'll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so, what you're seeing there is splash back.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You make sissy on your belt buckles? Meemaw's forks never had that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Here is a <b title='ultraviolet light [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_light">Wiki</a>]'>black light</b> to check them. And for your own <b title='a feeling of calm or not being worried'>peace of mind</b>, <b title='[<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080911131546AAXkSOI">Why does sperm glow under a UV light?</a>]'>you might not wanna shine that around the rest of the room</b>.<br>
[Later.]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, these look great. They're like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How'd you get them so shiny?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I-I <b title='buff - polish with a soft material'>buffed</b> them with <b title='a manufacturer of automotive appearance products [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Wax">Wiki</a>]'>Turtle Wax</b>. The man down at <b title='a full-service and tire automotive aftermarket chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Boys">Wiki</a>]'>Pep Boys</b> says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Way to <b title='make more effort than is expected of you'>go the extra mile</b>. Your meemaw would be proud.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My meemaw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you want me to return it for you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no, no, <b title='my little dear one [<a href="http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_mon_petite_cheri_mean">link</a>]'>mon petit cherie</b>.
<s>The cafeteria. Sheldon enters in the French maid costume.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you all staring at? Didn't you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
<s>The laundry room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is not my laundry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of <b title='of poor quality; sb who is trashy behaves in an immoral way, especially in situations involving sex ↗slutty, tramp'>trashy</b>, good for her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Those are Howard's.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ugh. Why are you washing Howard's man panties?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because if I don't, he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He's a famous physicist.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, yeah, I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's close enough.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't understand, why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because he's punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don't think I'm condescending, do you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm sorry, condescending means-<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='on the contrary (French)'>Au contraire</b>. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote">Wiki</a>]'>Don Quixote</b> is a book about a donkey named Hotay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>See, there it is, there's that twinkle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I knew it.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Howard</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the <b title='buttocks'>behind</b> and says, go get him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's not her fault. She's getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy <b title='sexually excited'>horny</b>. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid's costume.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>My God, that's terrible.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I gave you first <b title='attempt, try, shot'>crack</b> at it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why are you doing that? You're being mean to him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's mean to me all the time. You've heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>If you don't wanna get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they're great.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, the man torments me. I'm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It's not the same thing. Sheldon doesn't know when he's being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedgie">Wiki</a>]'>wedgie</b> from the rest of his brain.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine, I'll just make him do a couple more things, then I'll stop.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, you have to stop now.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>(Off) Bernadette, I wanna remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, damn. I'm sorry, I can't make it, but Sheldon's gonna go with you! (To Howard) And that's the last thing you do to him.
<s>A shop changing rooms.</s>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>(Off) Sheldon! I need your help!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is it now, Mrs Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>It's this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you want me to do?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>We're gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Off) I'm not sure how to do this.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>It's easy, just pretend you're <b title='put away - return sth to its usual place or to the place where it was before it was moved'>putting away</b> a sleeping bag.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sleeping bags don't usually sweat this much, but okay.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Now zip me up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>You're right, who am I kidding? You should've seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no, you know, I'm not really the holding kind of- Oh!
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are these?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow, that's amazing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Enters) I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could <b title='cover or wrap sb/sth up completely ↗envelope'>envelop</b> your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I should've sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Humorous. Now, will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, for heaven's sake. I did your laundry, I <b title='↗waterproof, fireproof, bulletproof, proofread'>pee-pee-proofed</b> your belt buckles, I, I even <b title='sprain - twist'>sprained</b> my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, Sheldon, there's only one thing left I want you to do. Don't worry, it's an easy one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Give me a compliment.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. You have very tiny hands.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, about my job. I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're obviously good at what you do.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, then why are you always <b title='rip on - make fun of'>ripping on</b> me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It's just that what you do is not worth doing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now will you give my paper to Hawking?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sorry, I can't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What, why not?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I'm available at his earliest convenience.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I thought he might be a little more excited.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom)
<s>Stephen Hawking's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Professor Hawking, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you, sir.<br>
<i>Hawking</i>I know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wanna thank you for taking time to see me.<br>
<i>Hawking</i>My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know.<br>
<i>Hawking</i>Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.<br>
<i>Hawking</i>That's nice. Too bad it's wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you mean wrong?<br>
<i>Hawking</i>You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite a <b title='stupid mistake; penis; erection'>boner</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, th-th-th-that can't be right. I-I don't make arithmetic mistakes.<br>
<i>Hawking</i>Are you saying I do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It's just, I was thinking- Oh, gosh, <b title='=gosh'>golly</b>, I made a <b title='a silly mistake'>boo-boo</b>, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.<br>
<i>Hawking</i>Great, another fainter.
