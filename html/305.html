<i>Howard</i>All right, Raj has played his <b title='ghost'>Phantom</b> Warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my <b title='strangle - kill sb by pressing their throat ↗stifle, suffocate'>Strangling</b> Vines. Choke on that, <b title='sb get screwed (ruined), sucker'>sucka</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, then I'll just cut your vines with my Ruby Sword. That's right, I did it. I cut <b title='them'>'em</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um. I have a question.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Warlord beats <b title='evil giant or mischievous but friendly dwarf '>troll</b>, troll beats elf, elf beats water <b title='fairy, elf or goblin'>sprite</b>, and basically everything beats <b title='changed by magic'>Enchanted</b> Bunny.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Unless you have the Carrot of Power.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I've got another question. When does this get fun?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play "Mystic Warriors of Ka-ah"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just uh, play a potion card.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Which one?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It doesn't matter. You can't possibly win.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, don't ruin the game.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How could he ruin the game?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding <b title='sb who communicates with dead people'>Necromancer</b> potions, which are only effective against <b title='wraith - ghost'>Wraiths</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daywalker">Wiki</a>]'>Daywalkers</b>, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are: four Fire Weapons, a Troll, two <b title='a cruel and frightening giant ↗Shrek'>Ogres</b> and the Jewel of <b title='The ancient Egyptian god whose annual death and resurrection personified the self-renewing vitality and fertility of nature'>Osiris</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See? Ruined.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, that is incredible.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>From your <b title='point of view'>vantage point</b>, it certainly must seem so.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"Photographic" is a <b title='a wrong or unsuitable name'>misnomer</b>. I have an <b title='of, relating to, or marked by extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images'>eidetic</b> memory, as I've told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of May seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I guess game's over.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Because the last time I didn't go, I ended up playing "Mystic Warlords of Ka."<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not "Ka. Ka-ah."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Buh-eye.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See ya. Still can't believe she's going out with me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nobody can.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That reminds me, I <b title='have sth to argue or quarrel about with you'>have a bone to pick with you</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You and I made a <b title='agreement'>pact</b> that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I don't remember that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-Man 2 at the <b title='an American movie theater chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres">Wiki</a>]'>AMC</b> Pasadena. They only had red <b title='a beverage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Icee_Company">Wiki</a>]'>Icees</b>, no blue.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where's my <b title='a female'>shorty</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty">Wiki</a>]'>Morty</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, you can't <b title='make me do what I have promised'>hold me to</b> that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because when I made that agreement, I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was <b title='sure'>positive</b> you never would.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You had left the <b title='food and drink'>refreshment</b> <b title='a table or small structure used for selling or showing things'>stand</b> in order to <b title='let yourself do or have sth that you enjoy'>indulge</b> in your customary <b title='done to prevent sth from happening'>preemptive</b> pre-show urination.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, so that's how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don't get a hot girlfriend?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, Raj. That's how it works.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Damn.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, no.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You have a whole bunch of 'em.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergency. If you like, starting tomorrow, I'll add a guest napkin, but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today. (Leonard snatches one) Good luck. That's the face napkin.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, have you talked to Penny yet?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I haven't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because I've been busy, because I haven't figured out a way to <b title='bring up - mention/raise sth'>bring it up</b>, and mostly, and I can't stress how key this is, because I don't want to.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to <b title='fix up - make arrangements ↗hook up'>fix me up</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not that simple. What am I supposed to say? "Penny, do you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again?"<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, I'm smart, I have a good job and I have only three percent body fat.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's true. I've seen him at the beach. He's like a human chicken wing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Leonard, come on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. I'll ask if she has a friend for you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A hot friend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride <b title='a space-themed indoor roller coaster attraction located at all five Magic Kingdom-style Disney Parks [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Mountain">Wiki</a>]'>Space Mountain</b> before they're 20.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll see what I can do.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work, you undoubtedly heard, "Hello, Raj. "How are you, Raj?" Given that you're wearing a new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater_vest">Wiki</a>]'>sweater vest</b>, you may have heard, "New sweater vest?" And possibly, though far less likely, "Nice sweater vest."<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That would probably save us some time.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Saturday night at the comic book store, they're having a "Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah" tournament. First prize is $500. If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What about the money?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have money.<br>
<i>Raj</i>This is other money.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How does it differ from the money I have?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Half of it will be mine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Leonard, help.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you kidding? I couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his <b title='fucking'>freaking</b> napkins.
<s>Leonard's bedroom. He and Penny are in bed.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, you really are a genius.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not really. I Googled how to do that. So, listen... have you ever made a pact with someone?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You mean like a <b title='pinky - little finger [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_swear">Wiki</a>]'>pinky swear</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie">Wiki</a>]'>Bert and Ernie</b>. You know, from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street">Wiki</a>]'>Sesame Street</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I-I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn't speak again till middle school.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Over puppets?<br>
<i>Penny</i>The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. I don't know where you're going with this, but <b title='be very careful about what you say or do'>tread carefully</b> because it may be the last conversation we ever have.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, nothing like that. The <b title='matter/problem/task'>deal</b> was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And you thought a good time to bring this up would be right after sex?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna bring it up before sex. And during, I was trying to remember what I read on Google, so-<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, it doesn't have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The problem isn't what's on the inside. It's the <b title='making you feel nervous and slightly frightened'>creepy</b> <b title='candy-coat - minimize the unpleasantness of'>candy-coating</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Will you at least think about it? Just as a favor to me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. <b title=' Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge, both girlfriends of Archie Andrews. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie%27s_Girls_Betty_and_Veronica">Wiki</a>]'>Betty and Veronica</b>? Oh.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Hey, Sheldon, the new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern">Wiki</a>]'>Green Lantern</b> <b title='a small statue of a person or an animal'>figurine</b>'s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to <b title='stumble on/across/upon - find or discover sth by chance and unexpectedly'>stumble upon</b> the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>All right, I won't set one aside for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I must have it.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay, I'll set one aside for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, Stuart, is the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton">Wiki</a>]'>Wil Wheaton</b> signed up for the Mystic Warlords Tournament, the Wil Wheaton from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Wiki</a>]'>Star Trek</b>?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton, <b title='also known as'>aka</b> Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation, is going to be participating in your tournament?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, you don't understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton. Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you're playing in the tournament. Sign here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995, I traveled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy <b title='sb who is training to be an officer in the army, navy, air force, or police'>cadet</b> uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my <b title='completely new, brand new'>mint</b>-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then. Sign here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My <b title='involving a lot of strength and effort, laborious'>arduous</b> journey, however, was for <b title='nought, zero ↗null, nil'>naught</b>. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Schumacher">Wiki</a>]'>Joel Schumacher</b>, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie <b title='A media franchise is the licensing of intellectual property (IP) from an original work of media (usually a work of fiction), such as a film, a work of literature, a television program or a video game, to other parties or partners for commercial exploitation.

<i>Penny</i>She's adorable, Howard. I think you'll like her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I, I thought that'd be a nice surprise for her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good, good.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I just told her you're an <b title='the industry of building aircraft and vehicles and equipment to be sent into space'>aerospace</b> engineer, you speak five lanauages-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Six if you count <b title='a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid warrior species in the science fiction franchise Star Trek. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon">Wiki</a>]'>Klingon</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Girls don't count Klingon, Howard. (To Penny) Right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy <b title='a feeling that you like or love sb/sth and that you would be unhappy without them'>attachment</b> to your mother.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm kidding.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Another delightful surprise for her.

<i>Raj</i>Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! (To Sheldon) We <b title='power + own (defeat sb severely ↗have)'>pwned</b> them, dude! Up top!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend.

He tasks me, and I shall have him. I'll chase him round the Moons of Nibia and round the Antares Maelstrom and round Perdition's flames before I give him up! [No one responds.] Prepare to alter course.}<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in <b title='Star Trek: The Next Generation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">Wiki</a>]'>Next Generation</b>. It's a totally different set of characters.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we'll face off for the championship.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It's really lame.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Silence!

<i>Howard</i>So, Penny tells me you're working as a waitress to put yourself through <b title='graduate school - a part of a college or university where you can study for a second or further degree'>grad school</b>. That's pretty great. What are you studying?<br>
<i>Woman</i>Microbiology.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, cool. So you could study me.<br>
<i>Woman</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.<br>
<i>Woman</i>I know, I'm studying it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing. It's a joke.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do you like science fiction?<br>
<i>Woman</i>No.<br>

<i>Woman</i>I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not as crazy as my mother makes me.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you've had a healthy lunch?<br>

<i>Howard</i>You live with your mother?<br>
<i>Woman</i>No. That's the sad part.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='unpleasant'>Rough</b>. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.<br>
<i>Woman</i>That's nothing. I couldn't ride a bicycle 'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh. Wow. You didn't, did you?<br>

<i>Woman</i>Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a <b title='a small round cap worn on top of the head by Jewish men'>yarmulke</b>.<br>

<i>Wil</i>I think he's got me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The year was 1995. The place: Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against <b title="relieve - empty one's bladder or bowels">relieving</b> myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the Fourth Annual <b title='southern states of the US'>Dixie</b>-Trek Convention, only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.<br>
<i>Wil</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now, I have my revenge.<br>
<i>Wil</i>You went to the '95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your <b title='grandmother'>meemaw</b> died? (Wil nods) That's terrible.<br>
<i>Wil</i>Yeah, it was. But, I'm really sorry that I disappointed you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, I understand. If anything happened to my meemaw, I'd be one <b title='↗console, comfort, condole'>inconsolable</b> Moon Pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me "Moon Pie."<br>
<i>Wil</i>It's a special relationship, isn't it, between a boy and his grandmother?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!<br>
<i>Wil</i>It's okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell's heart, stab at him!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure you can. Do it! Do it!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his meemaw. Enchanted Bunny.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No! Not Enchanted Bunny!<br>
<i>Wil</i>I call my Mee-Maw "Nana." And she's going to be very happy to hear that my Small Rock kills your Enchanted Bunny. Game over, Moon Pie.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I-I-I don't understand. Your grandmother's alive?<br>
