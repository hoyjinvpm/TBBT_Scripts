<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hmm. The problem appears to be unsolvable.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe we could run some computer simulations.<br>
<i>Howard</i>There are too many variables. It would take forever.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We've gotta be missing something. Okay. Let's start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here 8:10, and here 8:45.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. These theaters have to be eliminated.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why? They're state of the art, digital projection, twenty channel surround sound.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but they have no <b title='a beverage company located in Ontario, California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Icee_Company">Wiki</a>]'>ICEE</b> machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But, what about the <b title='a large number of screens [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_(movie_theater)">Wiki</a>]'>multiplex</b> here? The seats are terrific.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They have <b title='a brand of candy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twizzler">Wiki</a>]'>Twizzlers</b> instead of <b title='a brand of red licorice candy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Vines">Wiki</a>]'>Red Vines</b>. No <b title='relating to the lower part of the back'>lumbar</b> support can compensate for that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it's gonna take an hour to eat. And I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant <b title='close ↗approximate'>proximate</b> to a Sheldon-approved theater.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We could eat after the movie.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Unacceptable. The delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occuring at work.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hang on, hang on. There's a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle <b title='a frozen flavored drink sold by the 7-Eleven company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurpees">Wiki</a>]'>Slurpees</b>, which are essentially ICEEs, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here, or here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow. I don't see how we missed that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me? In what universe are Slurpees ICEEs?<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's how we missed it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a <b title='without precedent'>non-precedential</b> basis to create an emergency <b title='not planned, but arranged or done only when necessary'>ad hoc</b> Slurpee-ICEE <b title='equivalence'>equivalency</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I guess we only have one option.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yup, I don't see any way around it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bye, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>See you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Later, dude. (They leave without Sheldon)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They're right. It was the only option.
<s>The hallway. Sheldon opens the door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>(Runs up the staircase) Oh. Oh. Shut the door, Shut the door.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just do it. (Runs inside the apartment and then comes out) Get inside and shut the door.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, you didn't specify.<br>
<i>Penny</i>ls Leonard around?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. (Casts a glance at the board. Noticing that Penny's leaning against the door listening sth, he goes to the door and does so too.) I'm sorry, I don't know understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance how to proceed?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Sighs) The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs and I haven't paid my rent.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I see. Penny I'm not sure I'm comfortable harboring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No big deal, I'm just a little behind on my bills. 'Cause they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you recall, I pointed out the "check engine" light to you several months ago.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, the "check engine" light is fine. It's still blinking away. It's the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me, like, $1200 to fix it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, it occurs to me. You could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Deadpan) Yes, it occurs to me too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hang on a moment. (Opens a can and two ballons spring out. Penny gasps. He gets out a wad of money) Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, you got a lot of money in there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's why it's guarded by snakes. Take some.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Don't be silly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm never silly. Here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I can't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't you need money?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah, but-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is money I'm not using.<br>
<i>Penny</i>But, what if you need it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My expenses <b title='form a particular amount of'>account</b> for 46.9 percent of my after-tax income. The rest is <b title='divvy - distribute'>divvied</b> up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut <b title='flat broken pieces of hard sugar candy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_brittle">Wiki</a>]'>brittle</b>, and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or, her own protection. Take some.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? I mean, are you sure?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see no large upcoming expenditures. Unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with Adamantium like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a>]'>Wolverine</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are they working on that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I sincerely hope so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Well, thank you. (Takes some) Hmm. (Takes a little more) Hmm. (Puts one back, and then take it and more) Oh, God, no, I can't. Sheldon, honey, I don't want things to be weird between us.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'll pay you back as soon as I can.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course you will. It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you've <b title='subscribe to - agree with'>subscribed to</b> a linear understanding of time and <b title='↗casualty'>causality</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm regretting this already.
<s>First floor of the building.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, I've given the matter some thought and... I think I'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Interesting.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ask me why.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do I have to?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched. (Penny enters)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Penny. How was work?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Great. I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was that sarcasm?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was <b title='"No"'>that</b> sarcasm?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was <b title='"Yes"'>that</b> sarcasm?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Nudges him) Stop it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny? You appear to have a package here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thanks. It must be the <b title='a round flat cap'>beret</b> I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was <b title="It means they don't have the item you ordered in stock">back-ordered</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you know the beret is an example of a piece of women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the <b title='a decorative part on the shoulder of a piece of clothing'>epaulet</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's not lying. He does find that fascinating.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, whatever. It's not like I'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one like a month ago when it was back-ordered. Look, it finally arrived. All right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, would you just <b title='used to tell sb to stop criticizing you'>get off my case</b>? (Runs up the stairs)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Weird.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good. That was an unusual interaction. I wasn't sure.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You guys have an argument?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You clearly did something to <b title='irritate, annoy ↗exaggerate'>aggravate</b> her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm <b title='not knowing what to do or say ↗confused, puzzled, perplexed'>at a loss</b>. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions. And see if there's a <b title='stupid/careless mistake'>blunder</b> I overlooked.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Here you go. Oh, you owe me another $2. The price of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo_shu_pork">Wiki</a>]'>moo shu pork</b> went up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Sighs) Getting tougher and tougher to be a <b title='Jewish dietary law forbids eating any animal other than those specifically mentioned in Torah. [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070927061558AALf1sb">link</a>]'>bad Jew</b>. (Gives Leonard $2)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you. Leonard, what's my share?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, don't worry about it. It's my treat.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, really. How much?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's whatever. Ten or eleven dollars.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, which is it? Ten or eleven?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fourteen-fifty. But it's no <b title='important thing'>biggie</b>. You'll get the next one. (Raj whispers something in Howard's ear and both laugh)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_top">Wiki</a>]'>tank top</b> if he'd get his shrimp <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_mein">Wiki</a>]'>lo mein</b> for free.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What're you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner? That I'm some sort of Chinese food prostitute?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, Raj, what're you saying?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Because, let me tell you something buddy, I pay my own way in this world. Okay? I don't rely on anybody. (Raj trots into the bathroom) What was that about?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out. Kinda like a puppy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here, Leonard. Ten, eleven, uh, twelve, fourteen dollars.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's 14.50, but it's okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good. Dinner's here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, dinner's here. I'm having some, I'm having <b title='also take-out or takeaway'>takeout</b> food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're damn right it's okay. I've been having leftovers from the restaurant for like four days and I wanted something different. So sue me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a <b title='not serious or sensible'>frivolous</b> lawsuit.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, wait. You lent her money?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She needed money. (To Penny) You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Going home. Where I won't be interrogated like a criminal. (Slams the door and then comes back) Forgot my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_cookie">Wiki</a>]'>fortune cookie</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In case either of you have <b title='the act or crime of stealing'>larceny</b> in your heart, you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But if you're ever <b title='short of money ↗shy'>short</b>, there's always a couple of 50's in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern">Wiki</a>]'>Green Lantern</b>'s ass.
<s>Penny's apartment. There are many lighted candles. Knocking on door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A little mood lighting, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the <b title='atmosphere'>ambience</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, they're very considerate that way.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent. Then I had, like, $14 left over.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fourteen dollars, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Put it back in your pocket or I'll find another place to put it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back. It's actually one of the few <b title='idiosyncrasy - an unusual habit or way of behaving =eccentricity'>idiosyncrasies</b> that doesn't make you wanna, you know, kill him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. So you're a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I know, it's just- This wasn't the plan. It wasn't supposed to go this way.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, well, what was the plan?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh. Was there a Plan B?<br>
<i>Penny</i>TV star.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it's probably not as bad as you think. Let's take a look. Maybe we can find <b title='cut corners - save time, money, or energy'>some corners to cut</b>. Oh, here's something. If you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable. Just a suggestion. A hundred and seventy dollars for acting classes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes. I'm a professional actress.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. You had an acting job where you got paid?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Scoffs) That is not the definition of professional.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, it kind of is. Let's keep looking. Whoa. What's $1800 to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's nothing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4000-miles an hour.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, remember Kurt?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Your ex-boyfriend?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, he got arrested for <b title='take a whiz - urinate'>taking a whiz</b> on a cop car.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>He was drunk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I would hope so.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Anyway, he had a bunch of <b title='not yet done, solved, or paid'>outstanding</b> tickets and a <b title='a variant of an arrest warrant that authorizes the immediate on-sight arrest [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_warrant#Bench_warrant">Wiki</a>]'>bench warrant</b>, so I- You know, I paid his fines.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did he pay you back?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, but he will.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And that's based on the inherent credit worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh? What are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. But I might have to find a cheaper place to live.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no. No, you don't wanna do that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, moving is a big deal. Uh, you- You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they're not clean then your books smell like melons and it's- Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, do you know anybody?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Penny</i>And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Ugh. This moo shu pork's burning a hole through my <b title='the first part of the small intestine, next to the stomach'>duodenum</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Tsk, tsk. <b title='[<a href="http://biblehub.com/kjv/leviticus/11-3.htm">link</a>]'>Leviticus</b> 11:3</b>. Only parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Hey, what's going on?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We're on a <b title='↗hike, trek'>quest</b> to the Valley of Fire to acquire the Secret Crown.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You want the Valley of Fire? It's right here. (Grabs his stomach)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you guys wanna go on a real live quest?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Outside? I just made cocoa.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, come on, it'll be fun.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do you guys remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt? (They all raise their hands) Yeah, that's him. Uh, it turns out he owes Penny a lot of money and I'm gonna go get it from him. Who's with me? (They go back to the game)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ooh, double sixes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, cool, I got a sword.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I <b title='would really like to have'>could use</b> some help.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Here. (Tries to give him a "sword")<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You guys are unbelievable. You play a game to simulate adventure, but when there's adventure out there in the real world you just <b title='↗chicken out, cop out, wuss'>wimp out</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman? We returned home without pants.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests you don't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not afraid of him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Leonard fairly calls the question: Who is in favor of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's <b title='类固醇 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid">Wiki</a>]'>steroid</b>-<b title='infuse - fill sb/sth with a particular feeling or quality'>infused</b> ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? (No response) Say hi to Kurt for us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me. When <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_Rings">Wiki</a>]'>Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They did.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Plus, no one stole their pants.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. Enjoy your little game. I'll make this quest on my own.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it's shpriting a little.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You guys suck. (Leaves and then comes back) Come on, please. He's so big.
<s>Outside Kurt's door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. Koothrappali's going to <b title='urinate on'>wet</b> himself, I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's gonna run away, and you're going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Guys, there are four of us and one of him.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Which means his triumph will be even larger. <b title='minstrel - a singer or musician in the Middle Ages'>Minstrels</b> will write songs about him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look... <b title='frightening'>formidable</b>. (Knocks on the door)<br>
<i>Raj</i>I should've peed before we left.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Yeah? (Howard quickly makes a cross)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, Kurt.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>Lenny, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay. Um... You remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj?<br>
<i>Kurt</i>No. What do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't remember me? How could he not remember?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, not now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I remember him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, here it is. Penny's in kind of a financial <b title='difficult situation'>jam</b> and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And she sent you to get it from me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should <b title='pay'>honor</b> your debt.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>You do? (Raises his hand. Leonard Recoils. Turns out he just wants to scratch his head)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>"Feel" is kind of a- It's a strong word. Uh... I just- I think it'd be a nice gesture on your part.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>She'll get it when she gets it. (Closes the door)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, there you go. Problem solved.<br>
<i>Raj</i>A successful quest. Now let's find a gas station with a clean bathroom.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, the problem isn't solved. He just <b title='blow off - treat sb/sth as unimportant'>blew us off</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've got it. He didn't remember me, because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, Leonard, let's go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. You can leave if you want to. I'm gonna <b title='see through - not giving up doing sth'>see this through</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. (They leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I guess technically that was my fault. (Knocks on the door) I'm not leaving here without Penny's money.<br>
<i>Kurt</i>What happened to your backup?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't need backup. I have right on my side. And I'm wearing <b title='Cargo shorts are cargo pants shortened at the knee.

<i>Sheldon</i>Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. (Leonard's forehead reads "I OWE PENNY $1800 Kurt")<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe we should have your head <b title='↗certify, attest'>notarized</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>If anybody cares, I still have to pee.

<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much, it helped a lot.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sarcasm?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Darn. I can't seem to <b title='learn how to do/use'>get the hang of</b> that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, I know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and <b title='pick up - get'>picked up</b> a few more hours at the restaurant. But the biggest thing was, <b title='unexpectedly'>out of the blue</b>, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me. (Chuckles)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Did he say why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes. He said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right. (Chuckles)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral <b title='a moment of sudden insight or understanding'>epiphany</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nope. I just think he's really changed. We're having dinner tomorrow night. And I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> wear my new beret. Bye, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn't seek <b title='praise, admiration, accliam'>adulation</b>. He fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny's <b title='hook up with - meet and spend time with / have sex with'>hooking up with</b> her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have <b title='↗permanent, inedible'>indelible</b> ink on my forehead.<br>
