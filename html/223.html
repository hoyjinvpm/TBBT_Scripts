<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't comment without violating our agreement that I'll not criticize your work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then what was "Oh, boy"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great restraint on my part.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's nothing wrong with the science here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say "science."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Modifies something on his board) Okay, how's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You actually had it right <b title='in/at the beginning'>in the first place</b>. Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic <b title='prank - a trick, esp one which is played on sb to make them look silly ↗practical joke'>pranks</b>. Bazinga. Well, now, here's a peculiar e-mail. The president to the university wants me to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It doesn't say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at 8 and move my bowels at 8:20.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles. I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going, but I can't know both. Yet, how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I know the feeling.
<s>Sheldon's knocking on Leonard's bedroom door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why does everybody keep telling me what time it is?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Everybody?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You, the president to the university, his wife, their <b title='showing that you are in an unhappy mood, and do not want to talk'>sullen</b> teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You could've waited until morning. I know, look who I'm talking to. (Goes into the bathroom)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving <b title='monopole - showing that you are in an unhappy mood, and do not want to talk'>monopoles</b> at the magnetic north pole?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the <b title='National Science Foundation'>NSF</b> expedition to the Arctic Circle.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, "Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Well, do you wanna go?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course not. I'm a theoretical physicist. A career I chose <b title='mainly'>in no small part</b> because it's indoors. But, if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist who confirmed <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">Wiki</a>]'>string theory</b>. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art <b title='diorama - a model which shows a situation, such as an historical event or animals in their natural surroundings. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorama">Wiki</a>]'>dioramas</b> depicting scenes from my life.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. Maybe a <b title='a group of people arranged on stage like a picture'>tableau</b> of me trying to <b title='beat ↗punch'>pummel</b> you to death.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sarcasm?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I <b title='be in a situation in which you have to choose between two equally unpleasant or difficult situations'>am on the horns of a dilemma</b>. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='very easy'>Easy-peasy</b>. I'm doing it right now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not good with cold, Leonard. Yeah, how often have we had to leave a movie theater because I got a headache from drinking the <b title='a beverage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Icee_Company">Wiki</a>]'>Icee</b> too fast? I can't go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then don't go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says, "Don't go."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, then go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Listen to you. How can I possibly go?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Odd. President Seibert <b title='pose a question - ask a question, esp one that needs to be carefully thought about'>posed</b> the exact same question.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How was it resolved?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question <b title='suggested or introduced for discussion'>moot</b>.
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Just imagine. If he says yes, we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We could play outside.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We could sit on the left side of the couch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I could use the bathroom at 8:20.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Our dreams are very small, aren't they?<br>
[They enter the apartment]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good news, gentlemen. I have <b title='tentative - not definite or certain =provisional ↗temporarily'>tentatively</b> accepted-<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>-the invitation to join the Arctic expedition.<br>
<i>All</i>It's not gonna be the same without you. <b title='used for wishing sb good luck, esp before a journey'>Godspeed</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you, but your <b title='sentiment - opinion/feeling'>sentiments</b> may be premature.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, I don't like where this is going.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would like to propose, that the three of you accompany me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>To the North Pole?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I'll need a support team and the three of you are my first choice.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, there're others might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomachache. Now, I know I'm proposing an enormous <b title='a task or project, venture'>undertaking</b>, so why don't you take a few moments to discuss it? (Goes into his room)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, we're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm still within earshot. You may wanna wait for my door to close.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on, let's talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don't know how we can <b title='turn down - refuse an offer, request, or invitation'>turn it down</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't wanna go on an NSF expedition," say: "No, we don't wanna spend three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an <b title='of the anus'>anal</b> <b title='scrotum (bag for nuts (testicles)) / an odd, eccentric or insane person ↗nuts - crazy, windbag'>nutbag</b>."<br>
<i>Raj</i>But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar, in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You still might get on a magazine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, you guys are seriously considering this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And you think you can <b title='tolerate'>put up with</b> Sheldon?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I'm a <b title='an identity associated with the philosophical, religious and cultural systems that are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu">Wiki</a>]'>Hindu</b>. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life, we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon, and I'm reborn as a <b title='having a large penis'>well-hung</b> billionaire with wings.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm in.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, damn it. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">Wiki</a>]'>Peer pressure</b>. Fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition's team leader, <b title='a system of rules about the correct way to behave on an official occasion'>protocol</b> <b title='dictate - control or influence how sth happens'>dictates</b> that be <b title='phrase - express'>phrased</b>, "Fine, sir." But don't worry, there will be a <b title='a meeting in which people are given instructions or information'>briefing</b>.<br>

<i>Penny</i>(Knocking inside) Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Knocking inside) Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny!<br>
<i>Penny</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Now, honey, I already told you the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, this is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic north pole.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to <b title='give more details or new information'>elaborate</b>, I am going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz, and Koothrappali.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're all going?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>For three months?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Excuse me. (Goes to Leonard's apartment)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? That woman has the <b title='the amount of concentrated time on a task without becoming distracted [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span">Wiki</a>]'>attention span</b> of a <b title='a small flying insect that bites'>gnat</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon says you're going to the North Pole.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah. Pretty cool, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast. And we had to get <b title='physical examinations [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination">Wiki</a>]'>physicals</b> and buy thermal underwear, and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize. There's no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now, where do we <b title='if a decision, offer etc stands, it continues to exist, be correct, or be valid'>stand</b> on the freezer?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is he serious?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, it would help.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To Sheldon) All right, I'll see what I can do. So, wow, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is, awesome.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry. But at what point do you put this "see what you can do" plan into action?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just a warning, Sheldon. The freezer locks from the outside. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She seem upset to you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. She seem upset to you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A little bit.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='two "correct" for two guesses.'>Two for two</b>. I'm <b title='performing well'>on fire</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm gonna be gone for the whole summer?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That feels like a bonus question. I'm gonna stop here while I'm <b title='being successful; winning'>ahead</b> but I've had a great time.
<s>The walk-in freezer.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, and the purpose of this <b title='training'>drill</b> is to <b title='accustom ↗climate'>acclimate</b> us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Then where are your tools?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Right here. (Points at his head) All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we'll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently, I'm "ridiculous", I've provided substitutes which will exercise your <b title='delicate'>fine</b> <b title='an intentional movement involving a motor or muscular component [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill">Wiki</a>]'>motor skills</b>. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a <b title='old, but high quality'>vintage</b> Casio model 1175 <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_watch">Wiki</a>]'>calculator watch</b> I received when I won the Earth Science medal in third grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a <b title='a style of facial hair [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Dyke_beard">Wiki</a>]'>Van Dyke</b> on a 6-inch <b title='a small model of a person or animal '>figurine</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legolas">Wiki</a>]'>Legolas the Elf</b>. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a mustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children's game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove <b title='Actually, when you hit your "funny bone," you&#039;re not hitting a bone at all. You are hitting the ulnar nerve as it passes around the back of the elbow.

<i>Howard</i>For this, I went to MIT.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And begin. (Starts timing them)<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Grunting & gagging) I think I swallowed some paint.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves. (Takes off one glove) Oh, son of a bitch.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='unfavorable conditions, trouble'>Adversity</b> is to be expected. Continue.<br>
(Buzz)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>, am I gonna get sued.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I can't do this.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Me either.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo">Wiki</a>]'>Han Solo</b> let <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker">Wiki</a>]'>Luke Skywalker</b> freeze to death on <b title='a fictional planet in the Star Wars universe'>the ice planet of Hoth</b>? No, he cut open a <b title=' 2.5 m (8.2 ft) tall bipeds, indigenous to the ice planet Hoth. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_creatures#Tauntaun">Wiki</a>]'>tauntaun</b> and used its internal body heat to warm him up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You heard the man. Hold him down and I'll cut him open.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on. I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I hadn't thought of that. I guess we're done here.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Here, drink/eat this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hot chocolate with a stick of butter.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because in the <b title='very cold'>frigid</b> temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter. I'm lactose intolerant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Way ahead of you. That's an "<b title='a butter substitute [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can%27t_Believe_It%27s_Not_Butter!">Wiki</a>]'>I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!</b>" stick.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(On video phone) But, Mommy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>I don't care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?<br>
<i>Raj</i>If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.<br>
<i>Dr. Koothrappali</i>Don 't <b title='answer sb rudely, esp sb in authority'>talk back</b> to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, it's not. Howard, tell them.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste">Wiki</a>]'>namaste</b>. I understand you're concerned. But If it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going. And this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite, <b title='the decay that takes place in a part of the body when the blood supply to it has been stopped because of an illness or injury 坏疽'>gangrene</b>, acute sunburn, or being ripped to shreds by a 1500-pound polar bear.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents. Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I didn't say that. You never listen to me.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>He doesn 't tell me anything. He lives a secret life because he's ashamed.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>You're gonna hear all-<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt.<br>
[Cut to the hallway]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's up?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I got you a little going-away present.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, a blanket.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no no no. Not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. (Leonard tries it on) Yeah. So you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, wow. Cool.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm gonna miss you. (Hugs him) See you later.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Mrs. Koothrappali</i>I told you no. Why don't you believe me?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>'Cause it doesn't make sense to me. How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn't one <b title='an Australian-themed American casual dining restaurant chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback_Steakhouse">Wiki</a>]'>Outback Steakhouse</b>?
<s>Sheldon's bedroom. Leonard knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon? Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I want a cookie, <b title='His grandma'>Meemaw</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, it's me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But Meemaw just made cookies.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't think I can go to the North Pole.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Leonard, I know you're concerned about disappointing me. But I want you to take <b title='a feeling of not suffering or worrying so much, consolation'>comfort</b> from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, that's very comforting.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Comforting is a part of leadership. It's not a part I <b title='like very much'>care for</b>, but such is my burden.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Terrific. It's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Assuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't, how do you know this? Did she say it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's a blanket with sleeves.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that's clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you, is an emotional state you find desirable.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, obviously.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She does have a short attention span.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, I can't go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and <b title='connected with the body or with sex ↗sexual'>carnal</b> fashion.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You really think so?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to <b title='succeed in doing sth difficult'>pull off</b> another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga.
<s>The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Leonard, what time is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Seven a.m. I'm sorry it's early. But we're leaving soon and I needed to talk to you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, I don't know. You'll be gone and I'll notice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Well, um, what about this? What does this mean?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wine, a credit card and late-night television are a bad combination?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?<br>
<i>Penny</i>That wasn't a long hug.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was at least <b title='5 seconds. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, ...'>five Mississippis</b>. A standard hug is two Mississippis, <b title='at the most'>tops</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, I-I don't know what to tell you. It was just a hug.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Glad we cleared that up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I guess I'll see you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Have a safe trip.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. Bye.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, bye. (Closes the door and sighs. To herself) It means I wish you weren't going.
<s>The Arctic. Wind is howling.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Damn it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're out of ice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the <b title='mischievous or high-spirited behavior'>shenanigans</b> to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by <b title='↗dog, sled, sledge, sleigh'>dogsled</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you working on?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Crossbow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, wow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It is remarkable.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, who's up for a movie?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good idea. What do you think? <b title='a 1968 cold-war era suspense and espionage film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Station_Zebra">Wiki</a>]'>Ice Station Zebra</b> or <b title='an American film director, screenwriter, producer, editor and compose [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter">Wiki</a>]'>John Carpenter</b>'s <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)">Wiki</a>]'>The Thing</b>?<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>What are we having?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='reconstitute - restore (dried food) to its original state, eg by adding water'>Reconstituted</b> Thai food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Check.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Freeze-dried spicy mustard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Check.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And flash-frozen brown rice, not white?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, oh. Sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga. (To Howard) You're in my spot. (He scooches away)<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Raj) There's no time for a crossbow, find me an <b title='pointed piece of ice formed by the freezing of dripping water'>icicle</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Three months. This is gonna be great.
