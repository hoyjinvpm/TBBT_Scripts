<s>The living room. Leonard enters and slumps onto the couch.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good morning, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah we're gonna have to stop by <b title='an American-based home furnishing store chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery_Barn">Wiki</a>]'>Pottery Barn</b> on the way to work. I bought these Star Wars sheets. But They turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep. I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not going to work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just because your career's been <b title='not making progress'>stagnant</b> for a few years, that's no reason to give up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I was up all night using the new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-electron_laser">Wiki</a>]'>free-electron laser</b> for my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction">Wiki</a>]'>X-ray diffraction</b> experiment.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then you can drive. Let's go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and you'd have to make other arrangements?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You did.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't. Let's go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But how am I going to get to work?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Take the bus.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I can't take the bus anymore. They don't have seat belts. And they won't let you <b title='tie sth securely in position'>lash</b> yourself to the seat with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">Wiki</a>]'>bungee</b> cords.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't try, I succeeded. But for some reason, it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you're a big boy. You'll figure it out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Now take me to return my Star Wars sheets.
<s>The hallway.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny? Penny? Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, what is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard's asleep.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks for the update.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, wait. You have to drive me to work.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I-I really don't think I do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I don't drive and I can't take the bus.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Alright honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, ok?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then I hereby invoke, what <b title='be given to - tend to'>I'm given to</b> understand, is an integral part of the implied <b title='formal agreement that is legally binding'>covenant</b> of friendship, (Pauses) <b title='I invoke the favor'>the favor</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, dear God.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you're done, we'll go.
<s>Penny's car.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you for driving me to work.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know this is my day off, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good, I'm not keeping you from anything. Your check-engine light is on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm-hm.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Typically that's an indicator to, you know, check your engine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's fine. It's been on for, like, a month.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, it's fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>lf it were fine, the light wouldn't be on. That's why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it's not fine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, maybe the light's broken.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is there a check-the-check-engine-light light? (Penny drinks from her bottle) Oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cellphone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one's reaction time by the same factor as an <b title='28/30 ml'>ounce</b> of alcohol.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do you have any alcohol?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course not.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Too bad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're going up Euclid Avenue?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm-hm.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, good for Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Euclid Avenue is shorter <b title='in a straight line'>as the crow flies</b>, but it has <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_bump">Wiki</a>]'>speed bumps</b> which increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. (Penny stares at him) But <b title='You have the control. From Star Trek. [<a href="http://star-trek.answers.wikia.com/wiki/What_does_%22you_have_the_con%22_mean">link</a>]'>you have the conn</b>. (Speed bump thumps) Oh! Of course if you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here's a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The answer's tricky. It's Second Street. You see, you'd think it would be First Street. But In most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else. You know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. You know, Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, it's fun. (Speed bump thumps) Whoo! Another bump. Okay. Uh, I'll say an element and, uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? (No response) I'll start. Helium. Now, you could say, "Mercury." That would give me a Y. Ooh, very clever. That's a tough one. So I go with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ytterbium">Wiki</a>]'>ytterbium</b>, which gets you back to M. So you go, "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum">Wiki</a>]'>Molybdenum</b>." And I say magnesium. And you say "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese">Wiki</a>]'>Manganese</b>." I say <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europium">Wiki</a>]'>europium</b>. And you're left with "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelevium">Wiki</a>]'>Mendelevium</b>." And there are no more M's, because I believe that <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitnerium">Wiki</a>]'>meitnerium</b> should still be called eka-iridium. So congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?<br>
<i>Penny</i>How about we just have a little quiet time now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. (Speed bump thumps; Sheldon whimpers) I'm sorry. I'm finding your reckless <b title='nonchalant - behaving in a calm manner, often in a way which suggests lack of interest or care'>nonchalance</b> regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Pulls over) Get out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal-combustion_engine">Wiki</a>]'>internal-combustion engine</b>, I'm not sure I'm capable of performing diagnostics.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I said, "Get out."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, I'll give it a <b title='attempt, try'>shot</b>. (Penny pulls away; Sheldon is stunned)
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, Leonard, there you are. I'm ready to go home.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I just got here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. Perfect timing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I told you I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can't drive you for the next few weeks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. You said you couldn't drive me to work. This is from work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Frustrated) Howard, help me out here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, how do you propose I get home?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How did you get here <b title='at the beginning'>in the first place</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. But I sense that's not longer an option.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, I need to get to the laser lab. You're just gonna have to find someone else to take you home.<br>
(Sheldon looks at Howard)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, damn. I picked the wrong side.<br>
[Howard's scooter. Sheldon's screaming]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, God, not Euclid Avenue. (Screams)<br>
[Raj's car]<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road, anyway?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We had a difference of opinion.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Over what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I <b title='assert'>maintain</b> he was. Where are you going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm taking you home.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I'm not going home. It's Wednesday. Wednesday is New Comic Book Day. We have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Souplantation. It's Creamy Tomato Soup Day. And <b title='an American franchise of electronics retail stores [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack">Wiki</a>]'>RadioShack</b>. There's a sale on <b title='#7 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes">Wiki</a>]'>triple-A batteries</b>. We have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I have a better idea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You wanna go to Pottery Barn first? (Raj glares at him)<br>
[Penny's apartment]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? (She closes the door) Maybe if I turn off the nightlight, I can keep the sheets.
<s>The living room. Everyone's there.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good morning.<br>
<i>All</i>Good morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, sit down.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's in my spot. (Penny and Howard scooches over) Don't look at me like that. Everybody knows that's my spot.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, you know that we care about you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And it's because we care about you that we've decided we have to <b title='express opinion'>speak up</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're hurting the people around you, sweetie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So we've made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it. (Hands him a pamphlet)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"Department of Motor Vehicles New Driver Handbook"? (Raj nods; Penny smiles) But I don't have a problem.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.<br>
<i>Howard</i>This madness has to stop.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny's taking you to the <b title='Department of Motor Vehicles'>DMV</b>. I'm going to bed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why Penny?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors">Rock-paper-scissors</a>]'>rock breaks scissors</b>. Good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. Come on, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hold on. I've one condition.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We have to stop at Pottery Barn.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And RadioShack.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And the comic book store.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. (She and Sheldon leave)<br>
<i>Howard</i>I wanna go to the comic book store. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Now alone. Wriggles in his chair) I like comic books.
<s>DMV. Sheldon, Penny, and Howard are in line.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I still don't see why I need a driver's license. Albert Einstein never had a driver's license.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me <b title='make myself wet by urinating'>wet myself</b> at 40 miles an hour.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the <b title='testicles'>nuts</b>. You know, I gotta ask: Why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was otherwise engaged.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Doing what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Examining <b title='[<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)">Wiki</a>]'>perturbative</b> <b title='the distance between the middle and the top or bottom of a wave'>amplitudes</b> in N = 4 supersymmetric theories, leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop N = 8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, how about when you were 17?<br>
<i>Woman</i>(To a woman) Take this to the testing area. Put your name at the top. Sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back. Next. (Sheldon goes up) Application?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm actually more of a theorist.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The application in your hand. Give it to her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Take this to the testing area. Put your name at the top. Sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back. Next.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Look at the sign up there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Woman</i>Does it say, "I give a damn"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Woman</i>That's because <b title="I don't care">I don't</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just look. See, this first question makes no sense. Look, "How many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving?" There's no possible way to answer that. A car length is not a standardized unit of measure.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Look at the sign.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, it's C. Just put down C.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't need your help, Penny.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Listen to that little girl, honey. Put C. Next.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. Wait, no, hang on. Take a look at this next question.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How else are they going to learn? Look, question two: "When are <b title='roadway - the part of the road used by vehicles'>roadways</b> most slippery?" Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, "When covered by a film of liquids sufficient to reduce the coefficient to static friction between the tire and the road to <b title='very exact and accurate (He is a theorist)'>precision</b> zero. But not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."<br>
<i>Woman</i>Here's your <b title="↗driver's license">learner's permit</b>. Go away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I'm not done. I-I have many additional concerns about these questions.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Don't make me climb over this counter.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, come on. Let's go.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Next.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='ace - do very well in an examination'>Aced</b> it.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. That's it. Let's boot it up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Booting.<br>
<i>Howard</i>This is a <b title='using the most modern and recently developed methods, materials, or knowledge'>state-of-the-art</b> simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the Army.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is that why I appear to be in downtown <b title='a city in the Iraqi province of Al Anbar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallujah">Wiki</a>]'>Fallujah</b> behind the wheel of an <b title='Most up-armored HMMWVs holds up well against lateral attacks, but offers little protection from a mine blast below the truck.'>up-armored</b> <b title='High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee">Wiki</a>] ↗[<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummer  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummer%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummer">Hummer</a>]'>Humvee</b>?<br>

<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Here we go. Red 2006 <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Taurus">Wiki</a>]'>Ford Taurus</b> on the streets of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena, _California">Wiki</a>]'>Pasadena</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, mm....<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other color. I don't want any <b title='hassle - argue, quarrel'>hassles</b> with <b title='the police'>the fuzz</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine, what color do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know the pale blue of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker">Wiki</a>]'>Luke Skywalker</b>'s <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">Wiki</a>]'>lightsaber</b>? Before it was digitally <b title='remaster - make a new copy'>remastered</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Black it is.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Now, what you wanna do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, fasten your seat belt.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Mimes fastening his seat belt) <b title='make a short hard sound'>Click</b>. Are there air bags?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You don't need air bags.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What if a simulated van rear-ends me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.<br>
(Engine starts)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, now shift into drive. And pull out slowly into traffic.<br>
(Tires screeching)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Watch that, Watch out for the pedestrians.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God, wait. Slow down. Hit the brakes. Hit the brakes.<br>
(Tires screeching; car crashes; Penny hits him in the face with a pillow)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
[Continued from earlier]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry. Excuse me. My bad. Student driver.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How did you manage to get on the second floor of the <b title='a large three-story regional shopping mall [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale_Galleria">Wiki</a>]'>Glendale Galleria</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know. I was on the Pasadena Freeway, and missed my exit, flew off the <b title='a structure like a bridge that allows one road to go over another road'>overpass</b>, and one thing led to another.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe you wanna give it a rest and try again tomorrow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. I quit. (Car crashes; crowd shouting; animals chirping and whimpering)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. The pet store.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software. It's amazingly detailed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So wait. You're just gonna give up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I'm not giving up. No, I never give up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what is it you're doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm, uh, <b title='transcend - go beyond, be superior to'>transcending</b> the situation. I'm clearly too evolved for driving.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What does that mean?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and <b title='of, at, from or towards the side'>lateral</b> <b title='incisor - one of the eight flat teeth at the front of your mouth'>incisors</b> are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, those are indicators that I'm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No kidding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, wait, no, I'm not gonna so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind. You know, a <b title='↗Homo sapiens, nova'>Homo novus</b>, if you will. No, that's for <b title='anthropology - the scientific study of people, society, and culture'>anthropologists</b> to decide. But, I am convinced that the reason I cannot master......the <b title='unsophisticated, vulgar, of the lower social classes'>plebeian</b> task of driving is because I'm not meant to.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, you are. You're meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. Leonard, I'm meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it's safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's never safe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, well, I know that now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Homo novus doesn't know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, <b title='used to tell sb to not give up, despite difficulties'>hang in there</b>. Maybe you'll evolve into something with wings. (Smiles mockingly)
<s>Outside Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Comes out his office, wearing a robe and a shower cap) Good morning, gentlemen.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don't know about?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, he lives here now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive......he decided it would be easier to sleep in his office......and shower in the radiation lab until I'm finished with my experiment.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But you finished your experiment a week ago.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Smiles) Yep.<br>
<i>Janitor #1</i>(In Spanish) Oh my God. Again?<br>
<i>Janitor #2</i>It must be rats.<br>
<i>Janitor #1</i>Rats don't make toast and cut off the crust.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You saw nothing.
