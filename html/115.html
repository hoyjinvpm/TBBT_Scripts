<i>Leonard</i>On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if this <b title='a high energy particle accelerator [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercollider">Wiki</a>]'>supercollider</b> actually works, it'll create a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">Wiki</a>]'>black hole</b> and swallow up the earth, ending life as we know it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What a bunch of crybabies. No <b title='courage'>guts</b>, no glory, man.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, check it out. The school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Reads) "We are testing a new medication for <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety">Wiki</a>]'>social anxiety</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack">Wiki</a>]'>panic attacks</b>, <b title='an anxiety disorder characterized by anxiety in situations where the sufferer perceives certain environments as dangerous or uncomfortable, often due to the environment&#039;s vast openness or crowdedness [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoraphobia">Wiki</a>]'>agoraphobia</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive_compulsive_disorder">Wiki</a>]'>obsessive compulsive disorder</b>." Why would they be looking for test subjects here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board. (Motions for him to leave)<br>
[Howard and a bunch of guys are in the hallway outside Sheldon's office]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hot girl in Sheldon's office. (The door is open; and we can see a girl is standing close to Sheldon)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Whispers) Sheldon's office? Is she lost?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe she's his lawyer.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, she's free to examine my <b title='summary of the facts of a legal case, or underwear ↗boxer shorts'>briefs</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know, I'm disgusting. I should be punished... by her. Oh, look, I did it again.<br>
<i>Hot Girl</i>Now, that should do it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you for coming by. (The guys scatter; some leave; Howard leans against a drinking fountain; Leonard drinks from it; Raj looks at something on the wall) Hello.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, buddy...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"Bbuddy..."?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sorry I'm late. I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How can you be late? I wasn't expecting you at all.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nobody ever expects me. Sometimes you just look and... bam! (To Hot Girl; reaches out to shake her hand) Howard wolowitz.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, all right. Uh, this is Missy. Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh, and you've already met Howard.<br>
<i>Missy</i>It's nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You too, as well, also.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, how do you two know each other?<br>
<i>Missy</i>Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's my twin sister. She thinks she's funny, but frankly, I've never been able to <b title='notice; understand'>see</b> it.<br>
<i>Missy</i>(Strokes him) That's because you have no <b title='large enough to be measured'>measurable</b> sense of humor, Shelly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How exactly would one measure a sense of humor? A <b title='↗hydrometer, odometer, speedometer, thermometer, voltmeter'>humormometer</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I think you're delightfully <b title='amusing in an unusual way'>droll</b>. Or, as the French say, <b title='very funny [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100228152531AAi6Vfl">link</a>]'>tres drole</b>.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and... I'm sorry, what was your name again? (Raj walks away without a word and then takes the flier)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Rajesh.
<s>Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Was it perhaps destiny? I think it was destiny.<br>
<i>Missy</i>My friend's getting married at <b title='Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland">Wiki</a>]'>Disneyland</b> tomorrow night.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.<br>
<i>Missy</i>And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The papers could've been mailed. Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?<br>
<i>Missy</i>I guess that's why they call you a genius.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They call me a genius because I'm a genius. Tell mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds and that I'm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye. (Heads towards his office, but Leonard stops him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?<br>
<i>Missy</i>Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like <b title='guests'>company</b>. Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They were not friends. They were imaginary colleagues.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, you're here. We have plenty of room.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we don't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, Shelly. She's family.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So what, I don't issue invitations to your mother.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Well, it would be nice not to have to drive to Anaheim in <b title='↗[<a href="">Movie</a>]'>rush hour</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And don't ever call me Shelly.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So it's settled: You'll stay with us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3, level C, right? (Howard, Missy, and Leonard leave)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What just happened?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Missy</i>So anyway, we're eight years old and Sheldon converts my <b title='a working toy oven [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_bake_oven">Wiki</a>]'>Easy-Bake Oven</b> to some kind of high-powered furnace.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just <b title='typical'>classic</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I needed a place to <b title='bake sth in a kiln'>fire</b> ceramic semiconductor <b title='substrate - underlying layer'>substrates</b> for homemade integrated circuits.<br>
<i>Missy</i>He was trying to build some sort of armed robot to keep me out of his room.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you. There's a big flash. Next thing you know, my eyebrows are gone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not your eyebrows. (He and Leonard look at Missy admiringly)<br>
<i>Missy</i>Yep, I had to go through the entire second grade with <b title='bent, twisted, or not in a straight line'>crooked</b> eyebrows my mom drew on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had <b title='render - cause sb/sth to be in a particular condition'>rendered</b> you <b title='odd'>quizzical</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Those are not mine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? They have your little name label in them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah... no, I do... I... I use those, uh, just to polish up my spearfishing equipment. I spearfish. When I'm not <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow">Wiki</a>]'>crossbow</b> hunting, I spearfish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbor, Penny.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, you don't look that much alike.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can I get a <b title='used to express thanks, joy, or praise to God'>hallelujah</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='also referred to as "non-identical twins" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternal_twin#Fraternal_.28sororal.3B_dizygotic.29_twins">Wiki</a>]'>Fraternal twins</b> come from two separate eggs. They are no more alike than any other siblings.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hallelujah!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, guess what. I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome <b title='caused by a physical or mental illness; unreasonable; irrational'>pathological</b> shyness.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, good for you, Raj.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello, Missy. (Can't stop waving his hands) They mentioned there may be side effects.
<s>Continued from earlier. Raj is sitting next to Missy on the couch.</s>
<i>Raj</i>So, Missy, have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?<br>
<i>Missy</i>Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ah, yes, Patel, good man.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Sitting to the left of her) Do you like motorcycles? 'Cause I ride a <b title='a motorcycle, especially from the Harley-Davidson company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Davidson">Wiki</a>]; penis'>hog</b>.<br>
A hog?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You have a two-<b title='the tube within which a piston moves forwards and backwards in an engine'>cylinder</b> <b title='light motor cycle, usu with small wheels'>scooter</b> with a basket in the front.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You still have to wear a helmet.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Have you ever heard of the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_sutra">Wiki</a>]'>Kama Sutra</b>?<br>
<i>Missy</i>The sex book.<br>
<i>Raj</i>The Indian sex book. In other words, if you wonder, wonder who wrote the book of love, (Winks an eye at her) it was us.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Goes to the kitchen counter, stands next to Sheldon) So, Sheldon's sister is pretty cute huh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wasn't staring.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I didn't say you were. I just said she was cute.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, maybe, if you like women who are tall... and perfect.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Goes to Sheldon's desk) Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Goes over to the couch) I brought snacks!<br>
<i>Missy</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>, <b title='gherkin - small green cucumber for pickling '>gherkins</b> and...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Onion <b title='dipping sauce [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_%28food%29">Wiki</a>]'>dip</b>.It's onion dip. (Missy is not interested) We don't <b title='invite people to your home for a meal, party etc'>entertain</b> much. (Sets the snacks on the coffee table)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?<br>
<i>Missy</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, we Indians invented them. You're welcome.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, well, my people invented <b title='Male circumcision (from Latin circumcidere, meaning "to cut around") is the surgical removal of the foreskin (prepuce) from the human penis. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision">Wiki</a>]'>circumcision</b>. You're welcome.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done. -Do you wanna come?<br>
<i>Missy</i>God, yes. Thanks.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're welcome.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Bye, guys.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Bye, Missy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bye, Missy, see you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Goodbye, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah, no, uh, bye, Penny.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, you two have to back off.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why should I back off? You back off, dude.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, this is my apartment, and she's my roommate's sister.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So what? You've already got Penny!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?<br>
<i>Howard</i>So I can have Penny?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hell, no!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. Can I <b title='say sth suddenly that interrupts sb who is speaking'>interject</b> something? I'm ordering pizza online. Is everyone okay with <b title='an American variety of salami, usually made from cured pork and beef mashed together [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperoni">Wiki</a>]'>pepperoni</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I guess. Don't worry. I was going to order you cheese-less. (Leonard is lactose-intolerant. <a href="101.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/tbbt/101.html">s1e1</a>)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm a <b title='↗complicated, advanced'>fancy</b> Indian man. We invented pajamas.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, look at me. I don't have a foreskin. (Can't stop waving his hands, or can he? ↗masturbate)
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon... (Closes the door) are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hmm. She certainly has the <b title='pleasingly regular way in which parts are arranged'>symmetry</b> and low body fat that western culture <b title='considers'>deems</b> <b title='sexually attractive'>desirable</b>. It's noteworthy, at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their <b title='waist measurement of a person'>girth</b> suggested <b title='the state of having a lot of money or a high standard of living'>affluence</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's fascinating, but...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't say it was fascinating. I said it was noteworthy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, but... noted. But, my point is that, Koothrappali and Wolowitz, they're <b title='talk to sb in a way that shows you are sexually attracted to them'>hitting on</b> your sister. Oh, it's...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, okay. You know, I don't wanna criticize your <b title='relating to a style of speaking or writing that is effective or intended to influence people'>rhetorical</b> style, but we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's great, but my...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary <b title='if you make a detour on a journey, you go by a route which is not the shortest way'>detour</b> from what I now understand to be your <b title='idea, argument'>thesis</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Whatever. You have to do something about it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because she's your sister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> gone our own separate ways.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, uh, consider this... with your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I hadn't considered that. We <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> share DNA. So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her <b title='reproductive organs'>loins</b> is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Exactly. And you <b title='should do sth for'>owe it to</b> yourself and to <b title='following or future generations'>posterity</b> to protect the genetic <b title='the quality of being unimpaired'>integrity</b> of your sister's future offspring.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's <b title="the two tubes in a woman's body along which eggs pass from her ovaries to her womb">fallopian tubes</b>, they'll have to go through me. (Leaves. Leonard smirks and then leave too)
<s>The living room. Raj and Howard are wrestling on the floor.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, god.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I am <b title='a popular Hindu deity [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva">Wiki</a>]'>Shiva</b> the destroyer! I will have the woman.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm warning you I was <b title='[<a href="en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo">Wiki</a>]'>Judo</b> champion at math camp.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, now that's enough <b title='immature and foolish; childish'>juvenile</b> <b title='squabble - argue about sth unimportant'>squabbling</b>. You stop it. Stop it, I say! I'm gonna settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Who are you to decide that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's the man of his family. You have to respect his wishes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're out too, by the way.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Say what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's nothing personal. I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become <b title='having too much gas in your stomach or intestines'>flatulent</b> every time they ate an <b title='a brand name for a chocolate-covered vanilla ice cream bar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_pie">Wiki</a>]'>eskimo pie</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(To Raj, who is grinning) What are you so happy about?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not happy. It's the <b title='drug'>medication</b>. I can't stop smiling.
<s>The kitchen counter.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='as a result of sth, because of sth'>Now that</b> Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic <b title='money risked'>stakes</b> are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We all make mistakes. Let's move on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How so?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little <b title='The Mocha coffee bean is a variety of coffee bean originally shipped from Yemen [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocha_coffee_bean">Wiki</a>]'>mocha</b> in the family <b title='a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte">Wiki</a>]'>latte</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In principle, you have a point. But as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental <b title='drugs'>pharmaceuticals</b> to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I think you're focusing entirely too much on the drugs. (Can't stop pointing his finger at Sheldon. Leonard holds Raj's hand and gently puts it down on the counter. Raj nods his head gratefully)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Is it 'cause I'm Jewish? 'Cause I'd kill my rabbi with a <b title='Jews cannot eat pork because it is considered unclean by their religion. This comes from their beliefs that any animal which eats other animals is unclean.'>pork chop</b> to be with your sister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Am I? Here, eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.<br>
<i>Missy</i>(Standing in the doorway with Penny, looking at them teasingly) Oh, really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oops. (Still holding the piece of cheese)<br>
<i>Missy</i>Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why does everyone suddenly wanna talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.<br>
(Penny goes over to the counter and looks at Leonard seductively)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We all make mistakes. Let's move on.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Missy</i>Okay, I'm not even gonna ask why you're <b title='sb who pimps gets clients for prostitutes'>pimping</b> me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.<br>
<i>Missy</i>What on earth are you talking about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic <b title='a change in the genes of a plant or animal that causes it to become different from others of its type'>mutation</b>, an improvement on the existing <b title='second rate'>mediocre</b> <b title='family line'>stock</b>.<br>
<i>Missy</i>And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That would be you. But residing within you, is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to <b title='become covered with freckles'>freckling</b>, a Sheldon 2.0, if you will.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Sheldon 2.0?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the <b title='a man who wants to marry a particular woman'>suitor</b>, then the likelihood of conception will be reduced.<br>
<i>Missy</i>You have got to be kidding me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not at all. Frequent <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b> dramatically increases the odds of fertilization.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Okay, Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as mom <b title='express, state'>puts</b> it, "one of god's special, little people."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.<br>
<i>Missy</i>I thought it ended at "<b title='crazy; a crazy person'>cuckoo</b>." You listen to me. If you wanna start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. <b title='an invitation (to fight)'>Bring it on</b>. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are gonna go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember? (Sheldon recoils)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have an alternate proposal.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Go on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You donate eggs. We will place them in <b title='involving the use of very low temperatures'>cryogenic</b> storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you. That way, everybody wins.<br>
[Sheldon slowly comes out of his bedroom, cupping his hands on his private area]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
<s>Time lapses. The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>We have to settle this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.<br>
<i>Raj</i>She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you poor, <b title='believing sth that is not true'>deluded</b> bastard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't <b title='start sth - begin a fight, an argument, trouble, etc'>start</b> with me, dude.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You wanna go again? Let's go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sit down.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. If we're gonna fight <b title='about/over'>over</b> Missy, let's do it the right way. The honorable way.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Take that! You want some more?<br>
[Sheldon comes out of his bedroom to find Howard and Leonard are playing <b title='[<a target=_blank href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports">Wiki</a>]'>Wii Sports</b> (boxing).]<br>
<i>Raj</i>And he's down! (TV: 1, 2, 3, while Leonard is jumping up and down)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, come on! Get up!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stay down, <b title='a general insult'>bitch</b>! (TV: 9, 10) Yeah! Natural selection at work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I weep for humanity.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Struts to Penny's apartment and knocks on the door)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi, Penny. <b title='general greeting - how is everything happening'>How's it going</b>? Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, <b title='almost'>pretty much</b>. Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nothing, just <b title='catch up - spend time finding out what has been happening'>catching up</b>. By the way, may I speak to Missy, please?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Hi, Leonard. What's up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, since you're leaving tomorrow, I was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner with me.<br>
<i>Missy</i>That's so sweet. But no thanks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. You have other plans or...?<br>
<i>Missy</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh. All right, uh, enjoy the rest of your evening.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Thanks. See ya. (Closes the door)<br>
[Leonard goes back into the living room.]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.
<s>Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>What do you want, Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm fine. Thanks for asking. I've come to <b title='visit'>call on</b> Missy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Missy.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Hi, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?<br>
<i>Missy</i><b title='less strong "no"'>Not really</b>. No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then you are in for a treat. <b title='see'>Behold</b>, an ordinary cane. (Knocks the cane that he's holding at the door frame, pulls out a sheet of cloth out of the cane, drops it, picks it up. It reads "Will you go out with me?")<br>
<i>Missy</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. (Throws it away. Pulls out a smaller one out of his sleeve. It reads "Are you sure?") (Missy closes the door without a word)<br>
[Raj is at the door]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Missy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. I apprec... apprec... appreeee... Uh-oh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, honey. Is your medication wearing off? (Raj nods frantically)<br>
<i>Missy</i>Hi, <b title='a very cute person, of any age'>cutie pie</b>. I was hoping you'd show up.<br>
(Raj makes some strange noises and leaves the building)<br>
<i>Missy</i>We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to <b title='put down - kill an animal because it is old or sick'>put him down</b>.
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Missy</i>Any news you want me to pass along to mom?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosonic_string_theory">Wiki</a>]'>Bosonic string theory</b> to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotic_string_theory">Wiki</a>]'>heterotic string theory</b>.<br>
<i>Missy</i>Yeah, I'll just tell her you said "hey."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Reaches out his hand)<br>
<i>Missy</i>Come on, Shelly. (Hugs him) (Sheldon pats her on the back) I want you to know I'm very proud of you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really?<br>
<i>Missy</i>Yep, I'm always <b title='↗boast'>bragging </b>to my friends about my brother, the rocket scientist.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Upset) You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?<br>
<i>Missy</i>Well, yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm a theoretical physicist.<br>
<i>Missy</i>What's the difference?<br>
