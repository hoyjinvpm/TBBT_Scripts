<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, <b title='↗nail polish, manicure, pedicure'>Babydoll Pink</b>, let's see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad's feet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Vvoice off) It's just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the <b title='an instrument used for keeping a room or a machine at a particular temperature'>thermostat</b> two degrees!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw, <b title='fuck'>screw</b> the roommate agreement!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, you don't screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what, go to hell and set their thermostat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't have to go to hell. At <b title='22.7 Celsius ↗Fahrenheit'>73</b> degrees, I'm there already!<br>
<i>Penny</i>(After a knock on the door) Who is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hang on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can I sleep on your couch tonight?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You heard that, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Apparently, the one <b title='man'>fella</b> tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So you agree, he's <b title='crazy'>nuts</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I do not believe that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I'd just started at the university.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.<br>
<i>Man with a box</i>Oh, I bet you're here to check out the room for rent.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Man</i>Run away, dude.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Man</i>Run fast, run far. (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That should have been my first clue.
<s>Moments later.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really <b title='unable to act and think normally'>deranged</b> look.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback: Leonard is getting out of the elevator). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.<br>
<i>Large Black Transvestite</i>Yeah? {transvestite - a person, esp a man, who enjoys dressing as a member of the opposite sex ↗transsexual, cross-dress, drag queen}<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Dr. Cooper?<br>
<i>Transvestite</i>No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='thinking back to a time in the past'>In retrospect</b>, that was clue number two.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth <b title=' helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas">Wiki</a>]'>noble gas</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You said you're a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, radon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you asking me or telling me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Telling you? Telling you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, next question. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Star Trek</a>]'>Kirk or Picard</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, uh, well, that's tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Correct. You've passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters apartment. It is bare except for two lawn chairs, a television and some whiteboards) Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That depends.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't understand, their, their existence is conditional?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's three?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Each more <b title='frightening in a way that makes you feel less confident, intimidating'>daunting</b> than the last. Have a seat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No! That's where I sit!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the difference?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I've placed it in a state of eternal <b title='a right to have sth'>dibs</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can you do that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That's Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, yeah, experimental physics.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Doesn't concern you. You'll be going to the university every day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you have a vehicle?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A car, yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you'll be willing to drive me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, can't you drive?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can. I choose not to.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that's a point in my favor, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why don't you let me do this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, I just asked.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Last question. In a post-<b title='apocalypse - the destruction of the world ↗Armageddon '>apocalyptic</b> world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, <b title='procreate - produce children or baby animals, reproduce'>procreating</b>, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, I'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, good. I passed the barriers.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The second barrier. Don't get <b title='too confident about yourself and your abilities, arrogant, conceited'>cocky</b>. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, I guess.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This isn't going to work if you're guessing. When do you <b title='poo ↗pee'>evacuate your bowels</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When I have to.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When you have to? I'm sorry, I don't rent to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">Wiki</a>]'>hippies</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I, I'm sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine. I'll take it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is this it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, this is my room. People don't go in my room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So where do you sleep?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If people don't go in there, and you're people... You are people, aren't you? Making a joke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you do this often?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>On occasion.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your room. (Someone painted "DIE SHELDON DIE" on the wall) You may wanna repaint. (End of Flashback)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I didn't just move in. First we had to <b title='resolve sth by discussion'>iron out</b> a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">Wiki</a>]'>Firefly</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Does that really need to be in the agreement?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We might as well settle it now, it's gonna be on for years. <b title='↗acronym, abbreviation, uppercase'>Initial</b> here. All right, that's television and movies. Section nine, <b title='a group or collection of different kinds of things'>miscellany</b>. The apartment's flag is a gold lion <b title='standing on one hind leg with forelegs raised'>rampant</b> on a field of <b title='bright blue in color like the sky'>azure</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We have a flag?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Waves a small flag) Never fly it upside down, unless the apartment's in <b title='the state of being in extreme danger and needing urgent help ↗agony, anguish, torment'>distress</b>. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Future Sheldon and/or Leonard doesn't show up) Well that's disappointing. (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why on earth did you agree to all that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was the best apartment I'd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> wanna take it all the way.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard's bedroom.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Shh. Just pretend we're not here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sure he'll go away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm just gonna keep knocking till you answer. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you want? (Sheldon comes in) I didn't say come in!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I'm here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b>. "Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of <b title='about to happen, imminent ↗pending'>impending</b> coitus."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.<br>
<i>Joyce Kim</i>That's it! I'm out of here!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But, Joyce, come on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>12 hours? (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my, God.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do I get some sympathy now?<br>
<i>Penny</i>A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you're <b title='do - have sex'>doing</b> this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It's kind of secret.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, what does that have to do with Joyce Kim?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I'm not saying I would have.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what, that's it? You've stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work (Flashback: the apartment. The <b title='couch, sofa'>settee</b> has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is going on here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll get to you later. What are you sitting on?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I can't speak for these guys, but I'm sitting on my tushie. It's a joke.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, not a good idea.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Tushie is buttocks, right?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hilarious.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Explain the couch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But what's wrong with the furniture we have?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They're lawn chairs. And there was no place for <b title='guest'>company</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did it occur to you that was by design?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>According to the roommate agreement, I'm entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But you didn't notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I did notify you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, you did, did you? (Checks emails on the phone) <b title='used to show you are annoyed'>Drat</b>! <b title='harmed or embarrassed'>Hoisted</b> by my own spam filter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What am I doing in your spam folder?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm getting to it. (Back to flashback.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I assure you, you'll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune">Zune</a>]'>theirs</b>. (Hands back Raj's iPod)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And you just assume you're always right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not an assumption. Change seats with me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ooh, it's time for <b title='an American space opera television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Wiki</a>]'>Babylon 5</b>!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We don't watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because no one likes Babylon 5.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I like it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So do I.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>There you go</b>, three against one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They don't get a vote. It's one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But I said no to that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's a <b title='cold air that moves through a room and that you can feel'>draft</b> on my neck over here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, I get the draft?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're protected by your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckline">Neckline</a>]'>turtleneck</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. And it's a <b title='a false shirt front or collar worn under a suit or dress'>dickey</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hmm, I'm still not comfortable. Of course. There's too many people here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We can fix that. Let's leave.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, we can go over to my place.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Let me get my jacket.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're not going with us.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're the guy we're trying to get away from.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Well, in that case, I don't need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard's bedroom.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, are you having a playdate?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Do their parents know they're here?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they'll hear you!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That your dad?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She grows any more hair on her face, yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Three. I designed the engine myself.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Cool. Can it break <b title='a measure of speed based on the speed of sound [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach">Wiki</a>]'>Mach 1</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government's been working on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, this just might be your lucky day.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, what happened to the <b title='a sandwich cookie consisting of two chocolate wafers with a sweet cream filling in between [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo">Wiki</a>]'>Oreos</b> I left on the counter?!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I haven't seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, why was it his lucky day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mm, Joyce Kim was kinda curious about what I did for a living, and I was gonna kind of show it to her. It's not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, are we ever gonna get to the elevator?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, we're really close. Uh, uh, we're at the apartment. (Flashback.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The trick is to mix it into <b title='a water-gel explosive [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tovex">Wiki</a>]'>Tovex</b> in order to create a <b title='able to begin burning easily'>combustible</b> gel that will generate over 8,000 <b title='newton - an unit of force named after Isaac Newton'>kilonewtons</b> of thrust.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nice.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Cool.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Won't work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, but I've been working on this a long time. Trust me, it'll work.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't see your mistake, do you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's no mistake.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I've adjusted the formula.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not correctly.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I've <b title='been very tired or annoyed'>had it</b> with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a <b title='fucking'>freaking</b> couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physics- uh-oh.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's happening?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!<br>
(Sheldon flies the flag upside down)<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're waiting for the elevator?!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Right. (Runs down the stairs)<br>
<i>Raj</i>(The elevator comes) Wait. It's here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Give me that. (Takes the rocket fuel. Puts it in elevator. Presses button and jumps out.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What'd you do that for? I had plenty of time. (Elevator explodes.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're welcome. (End of flashback.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn't <b title='if sb rats you out, they are disloyal to you, esp by telling sb in authority about something wrong that you have done ↗tell on, turn in'>rat me out</b> to the landlord. Or the police. Or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security">Wiki</a>]'>Homeland Security</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, so, basically, you're the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So I did something stupid. I'm sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?<br>
<i>Penny</i>'Scuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback: Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not pregnant. Yes! (They high five) Haha!
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)">Wiki</a>]'>Ubuntu</b>, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello. Why do I smell <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methacrylate">Wiki</a>]'>methacrylate</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's doubt?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn't have tried to change it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='you did it right'>There you go</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So we're good?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go ahead.<br>
<i>Television voice</i>Up next Babylon 5.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Voice off) You're not even watching!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can hear it!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, so the dialog offends you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would hardly call that dialog!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're insane, you know that?!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't make me turn that flag upside down, 'cause you know I'll do it!<br>
