<s>A Chinese restaurant.</s>
<i>Howard</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A little jealous, are we?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, I'm not jealous. All right, I'd kill a <b title='sb who travels around and has no home or regular job'>hobo</b> if it'll <b title='get laid - have sex'>get me laid</b>. Now, can we order?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear Lord, they <b title='↗undo, redecorate'>redid</b> the menu.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So what? It's the same food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, is it? Look at this. <b title='a sweet, slightly spicy, deep-fried chicken dish that is popularly served in American Chinese restaurants [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Tso%27s_chicken">Wiki</a>]'>General Tso's Chicken</b> is no longer listed under specialties. It's now under chicken.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, General Tso.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's obviously a <b title='a small mistake in a printed document'>typo</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of <b title='dead'>deceased</b> mobsters.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, no, no, no, I think it just means it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It doesn't mean any of that! It's a typo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? Let's just get a pizza.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure, no mobsters there.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain chunks of mobster.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And why is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was listed under seafood.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Noticing their door has been broken open) What the?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The TV is gone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So are our laptops.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It's all right. They didn't take my comic books.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo">Wiki</a>]'>Nintendo</b>, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We like games.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocarina">Wiki</a>]'>Ocarina</b> of Time, The Legend of Zelda: <b title='faint light after sunset or before sunrise'>Twilight</b> Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics, and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man">Wiki</a>]'>Ms. Pacman</b>.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Assorted video games.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When does the <b title='Crime Scene Investigation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation">Wiki</a>]'>CSI</b> team get here?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In anticipation of their arrival, I've <b title='bag - put sth in bags'>bagged</b> some evidence. One of the thieves had the <b title='brave but rude or shocking behavior'>audacity</b> to <b title='stop himself feeling thirsty'>quench his thirst</b> while <b title='ransack - go through a place, stealing things and causing damage ↗plunder, pillage, loot'>ransacking</b> our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, Leonard. It's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>We're done here. Call this number, and we'll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, that's the end of your inquiry?<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Do you have any more information that might be relevant?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five <b title='A thought experiment or Gedankenexperiment (from German) considers some hypothesis, theory,[1] or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment">Wiki</a>]'>gedankenexperiments</b> necessary for a <b title='convincing'>cogent</b> restatement of the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem">Wiki</a>]'>quantum measurement problem</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How is that going to help them?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.<br>
<i>Policeman</i>Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are we supposed to do now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and <b title='hit sb with a bludgeon (short thick stick with a heavy end) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_%28weapon%29">Wiki</a>] ↗bat, baton, club'>bludgeon</b> us to death in our sleep.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Does that mean you've <b title='rule out - decide that sth is not possible or suitable'>ruled me out</b> as a suspect?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, how I wish I could.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom. Sheldon is restless. He gets up and checks the door is locked. He then moves his chest of drawers in front of the door. Goes back to bed.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. <b title='used to show you are annoyed'>Drat</b>. (Gets up)
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>I can't believe it. If I hadn't been working the dinner shift, I would've run right into the robbers.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm not scared. I would've <b title='↗go wild/mad/red'>gone all Nebraska</b> on their asses.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hand me the bat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It won't happen again, what's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're fine, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, then. Good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night. That was weird, even for him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mm-hmm.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I come in?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see you're drinking wine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, we are. And we're about to go to bed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, do you wanna sleep here tonight?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not what I want, it's what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>But you don't like other people.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do tonight. It's scary over there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's getting scary here, too.
<s>The apartment. Sheldon is drawing picture clues on his whiteboard.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Um... three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don't know. Star Wars?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Did we win? Can we go to bed?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, <b title='a fictional character, a supervillain who appears in comic books published by DC Comics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Zod">Wiki</a>]'>General Zod</b> trapped in <b title='a fictional prison dimension featured in the Superman comic books and related media published by DC Comics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Zone">Wiki</a>]'>the Phantom Zone</b>. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. <b title='an elementary particle in the Standard Model of Particle physics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Wiki</a>]'>Higgs Boson Particle</b>. How could you not get that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's right, Penny. It's all there.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure, but we've really gotta go to sleep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. I'll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. Good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait, wait, what's 0400?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>4am.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's like, 45 minutes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Keep walking. (Sheldon checks door then puts TV on his phone)<br>
<i>Woman on TV</i>It's quiet out there.<br>
<i>Man on TV</i>Maybe a little too quiet.<br>
<i>Woman on TV</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Man on TV</i>Just gonna take a look around outside.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bad idea.<br>
<i>Woman on TV</i>No, Jim, don't open the door!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Listen to her, Jim.<br>
<i>Man on TV</i>Don't worry, there's no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard's room.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who is it?
<s>Outside the apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>All right, we've got a titanium <b title='the metal bar of a lock that closes when you turn a key or handle'>dead bolt</b> and a reinforced <b title='vertical post at the side of a doorway, window frame, fireplace, etc'>jamb</b> controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What if they cut the power?<br>
<i>Raj</i>There's a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What if someone steals my keys?<br>
<i>Raj</i>There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll send them a basket of muffins.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Now, inside, we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where did you get all this stuff?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He just gave it to you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sure he would've if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn't all that good.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Entering) Raj, your car is blocking me- (A wire net falls on her, while a computer voice repeats the words "Intruder Alert") What the hell?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry, let me help you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wonderful security system if we're attacked by a <b title='a large group of fish ↗flock, herd, gang'>school</b> of tuna.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't worry, the net's gonna be electrified. <b title='imagine'>Picture</b> her on the floor, <b title='spasm - a sudden movement in which one of your muscles becomes tight and painful ↗convulse, contraction, sprain, twist'>spasming</b> uncontrollably.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Better.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sheldon's journal. Security system <b title=' If sth is in place, it is in its usual or correct position ↗set up'>in place</b>. However, sleep continues to <b title='avoid, escape, ↗include, exclude'>elude</b> me. I've seen the <b title='↗belly button, abdomen, tummy'>underbelly</b> of Pasadena, this so-called <b title='Pasadena is one of Rose Cities [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_City">Wiki</a>]'>City of Roses</b>, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, <b title='↗torture, agony, anguish'>tormented</b>, while out there evil <b title='lurk - wait, sometimes hiding, in order to frighten, annoy, or attack sb'>lurks</b>, probably playing <b title='a video game [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong">Wiki</a>]'>Donkey Kong</b> on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto <b title='narrow horizontal shelf coming out from a wall, cliff, etc'>ledge</b>.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard's window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate.) Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I heard a noise.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was us. We knocked over a lamp.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would you knock over a lamp?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We were going to have-<br>
<i>Penny</i>He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. No, she's right, I don't need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing? Use the door.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good thinking. Perhaps I'll check the <b title='boundary of an area ↗diameter, circumference'>perimeter</b> and make some warm milk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great, you do that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance">Wiki</a>]'>lactose intolerant</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, thanks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry about that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ugh, what can you do? Here. (From outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying "Intruder alert." Then Sheldon screaming. They run out to find Sheldon convulsing under the net.)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, are you okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm fine. Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. <b title='↗Command Prompt, Terminal, Text-based user interface, geek, nerd'>I don't like that</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that's overreacting.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Come on, Sheldon, you can't move. Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='if only - used to express a strong wish'>if that were only true</b>. Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound for the <b title='for as long as it is possible to know what is likely to happen'>foreseeable</b> future, I need to find a location that's more <b title='friendly, welcoming, and generous to visitors ↗hospitality, hostile'>hospitable</b> than the <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid. (Crosses it out on a map)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is he quitting his job at the university?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, he's gonna telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor <b title='a large circular building without a roof and with many rows of seats ↗amphibian, amphi- (both/round)'>amphitheater</b> portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, <b title='an American pioneer, explorer, and frontiersman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Boone">Daniel Boone</a>]'>Dan'l Boone</b>. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Born and raised. (Sheldon crosses Nebraska off his map)
<s>Sheldon's bedroom. Sheldon is packing.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana <b title=' mental hospital [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital">Wiki</a>] ↗lunatic (insane), bin (large container)'>Loony Bin</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I sense you're making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That's part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got <b title='rip off - overcharge'>ripped off</b>. But, those people moved on, and so should you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am moving on. I'm going to be a Bozite.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They call themselves Bozites?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They should. It's one of the first things I plan to <b title='mention'>bring up</b> upon arrival.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm gonna miss you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please, Penny, as you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and <b title='talking in a silly, emotional way'>maudlin</b> displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.<br>
<i>Sheldon on laptop screen</i>Greetings. As you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state <b title='in a very clear and definite way'>categorically</b> that my life will be <b title='diminish - decrease, reduce'>diminished</b> by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will <b title='give in'>succumb</b> to tragic and <b title='very unpleasant or shocking ↗fearsome, loathsome, threesome, troublesome'>gruesome</b> ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, that's so- (Turns to find he has gone.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Entering again) You might wanna lock the door behind me. This isn't Bozeman.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) How the hell do I know who's the friend and who's the acquaintance?
<s>Bozeman, Montana bus depot.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>That is a <b title='making you feel full of energy because it is cold'>bracing</b> cold, an <b title='making you feel healthy and giving you a lot of energy ↗vigor'>invigorating</b> cold. Lord, is it cold! {To the north, Montana shares a 545-mile (877 km) border with three Canadian provinces.}<br>
<i>Man</i>Hi. Help you with your bags, sir?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you, <b title='↗peer'>fellow</b> Bozite. And may I say, you are the living <b title='sb/sth that represents or is very typical of an idea or quality ↗emblem'>embodiment</b> of all the promises made by our lovely town's <b title='a group of local business people who work together to help business and trade in a particular town'>Chamber of Commerce</b>. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
<s>The apartment. Sheldon enters.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, look who's back!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me. (Raj smiles)
