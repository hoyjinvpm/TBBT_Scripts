<i>Howard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That isn't Klingon. It's <b title='the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish">Wiki</a>]'>Yiddish</b> for meat-filled dumpling.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, as it turns out, it's also a Klingon word.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Define it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Kreplach, a hearty Klingon dumpling.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Judge's ruling?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='you are wrong'>bllughbe'</b>. (Gives a thumbs down)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys. I need to use your TV.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's wrong with your TV?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. It just died. I'm getting a bunch of static.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did you pay your cable bill?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ugh. You sound just like the cable company. All right, so shh. <b title='an American television personality, producer, author, actress, and former model [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyra_Banks">Wiki</a>]'>Tyra Banks</b> is about to <b title='remove sb off a team/group etc'>kick someone off</b> America 's Next Top Model.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>All right, if you must watch, then mute it with <b title='The term "closed" (versus "open") indicates that the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer, usually via the remote control or menu option. "Open", "burned-in", or "hard-coded" captions are visible to all viewers.'>closed</b> captions, please.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, Boggle warriors. <b title='success'>Qapla'</b>.<br>
(The guys but Sheldown stare at the TV)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look at those women.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They're gorgeous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='a main character in Star Trek'>Worf</b>. Nice. Too bad that's a <b title='a word that is the name of a person, a place, an institution etc'>proper noun</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, look, there's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of- What a coincidence. It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.<br>

<i>Howard</i>Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's Anais. None of the other girls in the house like her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>House? What house?<br>
<i>Penny</i>They all live in a house together.<br>
<i>Howard</i>A house? Where?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. Somewhere in L. A.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait a minute. You're telling me that I'm within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I guess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And they live together and shower together and... have naked pillow fights? (Penny is disgusted and gets up)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, where-where are you going?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Dejectedly) To pay my cable bill.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, pencils down. I have loH, maH, and chergh. Anybody got those? (They ignore him)
<s>Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to <b title='a chemical element with symbol Cl [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine">Wiki</a>]'>chlorine</b>. Lucky for her I like my fashion models <b title='prune - dried plum'>pruny</b> and bug-eyed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, food's here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>There's the house. Freeze frame, freeze frame. (Quickly grabs a sheet of paper, covers the TV with it, sketches something)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Isn't it obvious? Every week they kick out a beautiful girl making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem. <b title='also known as'>Aka</b> the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>ls my hamburger <b title='Steak can be cooked to a level of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak">Wiki</a>]'>medium-well</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>lndividual <b title='a thick spicy sauce made from fruits or vegetables, and usually eaten with meat'>relish</b> packets? Onion rings?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Extra breading?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I asked.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What did they say?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you protest?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='loudly and strongly'>Vociferously</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, then, what took you so long?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just eat.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, guys. What'd I miss, what'd I miss?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Giselle's hanging by a thread.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, good, I hate her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then you're not invited to our wedding.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Gives her a box) Here you go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, do we have to suffer through this <b title='clearly'>transparently</b> manipulative, pseudo-reality again?<br>
<i>All</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Leonard) You and I have a <b title='existing or arranged permanently'>standing</b> TV schedule, which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Put it on the agenda.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have to make a motion to put it on the agenda.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll make a motion but you're not gonna like it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. <b title='make fun of'>Mock</b> parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off. It's totally gonna be Summer. (Raj squeals)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's one onion ring.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Just put it back before he comes. (Penny throws it back)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No no, I don't think that's where it was.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, here he comes. Deny, deny, deny, people. Wall of silence.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who touched my-?<br>
<i>All</i>Penny. Penny did it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would you do that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. I didn't know. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have two strikes. <b title='A strike in baseball results when a batter swings at and misses a pitch, does not swing at a pitch in the strike zone or hits a foul ball that is not caught. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">Wiki</a>]'>Three strikes and you're out</b>. It's a sports metaphor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>A sports metaphor?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, baseball.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, yeah, I'll-I'll play along. What was my first strike?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding e-mail humor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I did?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The photo of the cat who wants to "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Has_Cheezburger%3F">Wiki</a>]'>Has Cheezburger?</b>"<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, everybody loves <b title='an image macro (image superimposed with text for humorous effect) of one or more cats'>lolcats</b>. They're cute and they can't spell... because they're cats.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I trusted you with my e-mail address and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet <b title='trivial'>banality</b>. Strike one. Touching my food, strike two.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't worry, they only stay on your record for a year.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You can get them removed early but you have to take his class.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, I touched one onion ring.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And then you put it back. <b title='compromise - bring into danger'>Compromising</b> the integrity of all the other onion rings.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look, I wish I could be more <b title='not strict'>lenient</b> with you. But since you've become a permanent member of our social group, I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Congratulations, you're officially one of us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Chants) One of us, one of us.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what a thrill.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're sitting in my spot.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, you've gotta be kidding me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, she's in my spot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, yeah. (To Penny) Uh, see, here's the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't care. I'm <b title='If you take or make a stand, you do something or say something in order to make it clear what your attitude to a particular thing is ↗put my foot down'>taking a stand</b>. Metaphorically.<br>

<i>Penny</i>Oh, strike three. (Goes out of the apartment with Leonard in tow) I'm banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Listen, don't worry, I'll talk to him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you do that. <b title='Just let me know'>Just so I know</b>, would you be open to taking his class? (Penny closes her door) You can do it online.

<i>Howard</i>So based on our <b title='the process of determining the location of a point by measuring angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation">Wiki</a>]'>triangulation</b>, we've narrowed the location of the Top Model house to three square miles in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Hills">Wiki</a>]'>Hollywood Hills</b>.<br>

<i>Howard</i>When we find it, you wanna go with us?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>To do what?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Party with the pretty girls, dude.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you insane? You're not gonna party with them. You're not even gonna get near that place.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong. The entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, My fellow Americans, before this year is out, we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's Top Models.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And a large number of people will believe it never happened.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, let me guess. <b title='a flour/corn tortilla filled with a savoury mixture containing cheese, other ingredients, and/or vegetables, (often) then folded in half to form a half-moon shape.

<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don't like your attitude.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't do that. Not only is it a violation of California State Law, it <b title='fly in the face of - go against'>flies directly in the face of</b> Cheesecake Factory policy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, no, there's a new policy: No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh-huh. (They go away)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, here's the thing. Um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible. And he agrees that he was unreasonable and <b title='beyond certain set or assumed limits'>out of line</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Well, that's great.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Oh, just apologize to him, okay?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? I'm not gonna apologize to that <b title='idiot'>nutcase</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh come on, it's easy. He'll even tell you what to say.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, don't you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you're just encouraging him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're not encouraging. It's more like <b title="knuckle under - accept sb else's authority">knuckling under</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, I like hanging out with you guys but I'm not gonna apologize for something I didn't do.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, actually, technically, you did do it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's strike one, Leonard.<br>
[Continued from earlier.]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here you go. Quesadilla. Salad. Here's your pizza. And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my manager, barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Go ahead. Eat it. I dare you.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>That's it. There's the house. I found the America's top models!<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look. On the roof. Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. <b title='totally naked'>European style</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can recognize people on Google Earth?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Of course not. I got a buddy of mine at <b title='North American Aerospace Defense Command [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command">Wiki</a>]'>NORAD</b> to have a spy <b title='male honey-bee'>drone</b> fly over.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>NORAD? You're using military aircraft?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Wiki</a>]'>Siberia</b>. I took it an hour out of its way, <b title='at the most'>tops</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Okay, where is he?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Here. Try and go online.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Problem with the Wi-Fi?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, just try.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On screen) Greetings, hamburger-toucher.

<i>Leonard</i>Thanks a lot, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you complaining about? I'm the one who has to take the class again.
<s>The hallway and the staircase.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh! Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Time to do your laundry, huh?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know. Every Saturday at 8:15. Easy to anticipate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you implying?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm implying that you're a creature of habit. And if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it...unpleasant. (Sheldon runs off to the laundry room) Knuckle under my ass. (The laundry room) Oh, no. Are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No problem. I'll just do my laundry another night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your <b title='knowledge/understanding'>ken</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well, your <b title="Barbie's boyfriend">Ken</b> can kiss my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie">Wiki</a>]'>Barbie</b>.

<i>Penny</i>Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Where are my clothes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your clothes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes. I left them in the washers. When I went to get them, they were gone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? Despite the sign that says: "Do not leave laundry unattended"?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, where are my clothes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, I do recall seeing some female <b title='underwear'>undergarments</b>. Where was that? Oh, yes. Earlier this evening I happened to <b title='stare'>gaze</b> out the window and a <b title='bra ↗lingerie'>brassiere</b> caught my eye. Do those look familiar?<br>
<i>Penny</i>How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add: Mua-ha-ha.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get them down.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Apologize.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Never.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play <b title='underpants'>panty</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinata">Wiki</a>]'>pinata</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, wait, Sheldon. This's gotten way out of hand. Okay. I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things. How about we just call it even, and move on with our lives?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've done no stupid things.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Alright look, you've gotta meet me halfway here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am meeting you halfway. I'm willing to <b title='admit'>concede</b> that you've done some stupid things.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. (They glare at him) What happened?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it's junior rodeo on. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, not junior rodeo. (To Sheldon) What did you do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I had no choice, Leonard. She ruined laundry night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Looks out of the window) Ooh!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mua-ha-ha.

<i>Leonard</i>No. Look, this has to stop.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right. I really didn't wanna do this, but... here. (Hands her something)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon's <b title='a type of rock that comes from the planet Krypton in the Superman stories. It is harmful to Superman.'>kryptonite</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Reads the piece of paper) Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He can never know that I gave that to you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but- But this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It will shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.

<i>Raj</i>Pause it. That's it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the Top Model house.<br>
<i>Howard</i>God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, for the record, what you guys are doing is really creepy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know what, if it's "creepy" to use the Internet, military satellites and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can <b title='pay an informal visit ↗come/drop/stop by'>drop in on</b> them unexpectedly, then fine, I'm "creepy." (Telephone rings)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second, I'll get him. Sheldon, it's for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Your mother.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good. (On phone) Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And-and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that's not fair. Why should I have to apologize? I really don't think this is the kind of thing Jesus <b title='concern yourself with/about sth - become involved in sth because you are interested in it or because it worries you'>concerns himself with</b>. No, you're right. I don't really know what Jesus thinks about. All right! Goodbye. (To Leonard) Did you tell on me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes. (Smiles)

<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny. Penny. (She opens the door) I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here's your laundry. I <b title='officially end a law ↗abolish, repeal, revoke'>rescind</b> your strikes and you are no longer banished.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Can I sit wherever I want? (Sheldon's face twitches, it looks like he's about to erupt) No, no, no. Never mind. Never mind. That's, that's not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well played.<br>
