<i>Sheldon</i>Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Atzel's fortress. Now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check. (Pauses) All right, Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. (Banglng nearby) Sheldor is <b title='away from keyboard'>AFK</b>. (Goes into the hallway to check it) Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You appear to have put your car key in the door lock. Are you aware of that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, then.<br>
(Penny drops her shopping bag)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Damn it, damn it, damn it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I can't get the damn key out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's not surprising. That <b title='a maker of hand-crafted residential and commercial hardware [<a href="http://www.baldwinhardware.com/Home.aspx">Wiki</a>]'>Baldwin</b> lock on your door uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders whereas the key for your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen">Wiki</a>]'>Volkswagen</b> uses a center-cylinder system.

<i>Penny</i>(Sarcasticly) Thank you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're welcome. (Penny wheels around and gives him a glare) Point of inquiry: Why did you put your car key in the door lock?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why? I'll tell you why. Because Today I had an audition. It took me two hours to get there. I waited an hour for my turn. And before I could even start, they told me I look too <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwest">Wiki</a>]'>Midwest</b> for the <b title='role'>part</b>. Too Midwest. What the hell does that even mean?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia">Wiki</a>]'>Scandinavian</b> and <b title='used to describe the ancient culture and language of the peoples of northern Europe'>Germanic</b> peoples, who have characteristic facial-<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know what it means, Sheldon. God. You know, I have been in L. A. for almost two years now. I haven't gotten a single acting job. I've accomplished nothing. Haven't gotten a <b title='pay rise'>raise</b> at work. Haven't even had sex in six months. And just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, actually, insects are a dietary <b title='an important product, esp a food, that people eat or use regularly'>staple</b> in many cultures. They're almost pure protein.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Picks up a bag, but the bottom splits open and things drop out) Oh, son of a bitch.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe the <b title='small drops of water that are formed when steam or warm air touches a cold surface'>condensation</b> on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key <b title='a difficult problem that seems to have no solution'>conundrum</b>, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I did. He said he'll get here when he gets here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're frustrated because he <b title='phrase - express'>phrased</b> his reply in a form of meaningless <b title='a statement, sentence, etc in which the meaning is repeated in an unnecessary way'>tautology</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. (Slides along the wall, sits on the floor, and cries)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to comfort a small child'>There, there</b>. Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, Sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing floor, sobbing like a 3-year-old.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, then. (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Penny</i>For God's sake. (Springs up from the floor and storms into Sheldon's apartment)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just when I think I've <b title='get the hang of - grasp the meaning of sth'>gotten the hang of</b> sarcasm.
<s>The living room, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Make yourself comfortable. (Penny goes to sit on his spot) Not there.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Gets up and slumps down on to the right side of the couch) Aw, God. (Sheldon wants to get past her, but she puts her feet on the coffee table, blocking him. They stare at each other a while, lastly she reluctantly moves her feet back)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sheldor is back online.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldor?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The Conqueror.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Speaks into the microphone of his headset) AFK. (To Penny) I'm playing "Age of Conan, " an online multiplayer game set in the universe of <b title='an American author [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Howard">Wiki</a>]'>Robert E. Howard</b>'s Conan the Barbarian.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sheldor back online.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's AFK?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>AFK. (To Penny) Away from keyboard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I see.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What does <b title='He thought Penny said "OIC"'>that</b> stand for?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I see?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but what does it stand for?
<s>The staircase and the hall. A tub of Penny's ice-cream is leaning against the floor. A cat is drinking the melt ice-cream. Leonard looks at it quizzically. The cat looks at him.</s>
[In the living room]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. Can I see them in another color?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just click on them.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Now, congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, guess what? I'm a level three warrior.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. Do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I only bring it up because your ice cream's melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh-huh. (To Sheldon) Do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It doesn't matter, right now you're looking for treasure.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. (Leonard motions Sheldon to follow him. Sheldon gets up) Wait wait, where are you going?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go ahead. You're okay. If you run into crocodiles, just kick them with your boots.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna <b title='make me know what has been happening'>catch me up</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, let's see. Uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key because her face is overly Midwestern. Uh... she hasn't had sex in six months. And she ate a fly.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, a treasure <b title='trunk'>chest</b>. I'm rich.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Level three and she thinks she's rich. What a <b title='sb who is new to a particular group, activity, game, field of study etc ↗rookie, newbie, veteran'>newb</b>.<br>
[Continued from earlier. Penny has left. Raj is doing something.]<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, we're all <b title='ready to do sth'>set</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='make a car, boat etc go as fast as it can'>Let her rip</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, check it out. It's just corn starch and water.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They make up a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid">Wiki</a>]'>non-Newtonian fluid</b> which is liquid but solid under the <b title='connected with sounds made by hitting things'>percussive</b> action of the speaker.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's what makes it get all <b title='funky music is simple with a strong rhythm that is easy to dance to'>funky</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, okay. Uh, listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.<br>
(Raj whispers something in Howard's ear)<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, that's what she said, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I bought the game and I've been exploring the lsland of Tortage. But I can't figure out how to pass the guard captain.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you have an enchanted sword?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No no, I've a bronze <b title='a weapon like a knife with two sharp edges'>dagger</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can't <b title='kill'>slay</b> the guard captain with a bronze dagger. Lord, it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All-alright, how do I get the sword?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you been to the Temple of Mitra?<br>
<i>Penny</i>ls that the place on the hill with a weird priest in front of it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No no no, it's- Oh for God's sakes, give me (Snatches her laptop).<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you. I really appreciate this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're gonna have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Don't <b title='treat sb in a condescending way'>patronize</b> me. Just get the sword.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What the <b title='fuck'>frak</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title="I don't know">Beats me</b>. They were playing all last night too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's like some kind of weird comic-book <b title='crossing over'>crossover</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Like if <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_%28comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>Hulk</b> were dating <b title='a fictional character in Peanuts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint_Patty">Wiki</a>]'>Peppermint Patty</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, that's <b title='best friend to tomboy Peppermint Patty; displays a romantic interest in Charlie Brown [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcie">Wiki</a>]'>Marcie</b>. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb'>There you go</b>, one enchanted sword.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, give me, give me. I wanna kill the guard captain. (Goes back to her apartment and slams her door)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That girl needs to get a life.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom. Someone knocks on the door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Sheldon. (Goes over to the bedside) Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Springs bolt upright) Danger. Danger.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No danger, it's just me, Penny. Listen, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're in my bedroom.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. -Leonard gave me an emergency key.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>People can't be in my bedroom.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok. Well can we go talk in the living room?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I spilled grape juice.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, wear different pajamas.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can't wear different pajamas, these are my Monday pajamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok, fine. Just tell me, is it too soon to join a <b title='a long difficult search'>quest</b> to the Black Castle?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah yeah. By some guys in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest">Wiki</a>]'>Budapest</b>. I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course it's not. You're only a level 25. These Hungarians are just using you for dragon <b title='food for animals'>fodder</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust a <b title='a large number of people'>horde</b> of Hungarian Barbarians.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please, Penny, enough. I have to sleep.<br>
(Leonard comes out of his room)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, you were great. Thanks. Oh. Hey Leonard, listen, don't go in Sheldon's room. He's not wearing bottoms.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Knocks on Sheldon's door) Sheldon, you wanna catch me up again?
<s>Dr. Eric Gablehauser's office.</s>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>People, I am very busy today.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I realize that, Dr. Gablehauser, but it is your job as head of the department to mediate all intra-departmental disputes. University Policy Manual, chapter 4, subsection 2: "Mediation of lntra-departmental Disputes."<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>(Sighs) Fine.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Dr. Winkle, what colorful name did you call Dr. Cooper this time?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Dr. Dumb-ass.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Dr. Cooper, Dr. Winkle apologizes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, she doesn't.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>No, I don't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Here's the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the <b title='big computer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">Wiki</a>]'>mainframe</b> in Buckman 204 and Dr. Winkle just <b title='with desire'>wantingly</b> ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down on every slot for the next six months.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If it is a crime to ensure the university's resources are not being <b title='squader - carelessly waste'>squandered</b> chasing subatomic <b title='wild goose chase - an attempt to find something that does not exist or that you are very unlikely to discover'>wild geese</b> then I plead guilty.<br>
(Phone ringing)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Penny. (Hangs up)<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>You need to get that, Dr. Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>God, no.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Oh don't turn it off. You might miss your call from Nobel committee letting you know you've been nominated as dumb-ass <b title='sb who has won a prize for their achievements, esp a Nobel prize'>laureate</b> of the year.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yeah, well, you wouldn't even be nominated.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Dr. Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-loop calculations and simulations to run. All he's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock (Phone rings)<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>(Picks up the phone) Excuse me. (On phone) Gablehauser. (To Sheldon) It's for you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On phone) Hello? Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you're not prepared for the <b title='holy place'>Sanctum</b> of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five and one should be a level 35 healer. No, Penny, I can't log on and help you. We'll talk when I get home. (Hangs up) I'm not getting the computing time, am l? (Dr. Gablehauser shakes his head)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Dumb-ass. (Leaves)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Enters) Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep. She is interfering with my work. And if I had another significant aspect of my life, I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why should I do something? You're the one who introduced her online gaming.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself, none of this would be happening.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you just tell her to leave you alone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did. I told her. I texted her. I sent out a very <b title='expressing an opinion, idea etc in a clear, strong way'>emphatic</b> Twitter. I even changed my Facebook status to "Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone." I don't know what else to do.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, what am I supposed to do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know. But if you don't figure something out, I warn you, I shall become very difficult to live with.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You mean, up until now we've been experiencing the happy fun-time Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll go talk to her. (Springs up from his seat and leaves)
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>No, Fritz, I need you on my <b title='left or right side of an army or a body of troops'>flank</b>. No, I don't know German. <b title='In German, flankieren = be at side of'>Flankenzei</b>, flankenzei. (Knocklng on door)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey, Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Busy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't work on Mondays.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's Thursday. Listen, Penny-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ugh. Queen Penelope AFK. What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Uh... Here's the thing. Um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves, through no fault of their own, you know, kind of addicted.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, get to the point. I'm about to level up here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's just, if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life, it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they can get a false sense of accomplishment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, <b title='rapid or babbling talk'>jabber</b>, jabber, jabber. (Into the microphone) Okay, boys, Queen Penelope's back online.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, you've got... <b title='a brand of cheese-flavored, puffed cornmeal [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetos">Wiki</a>]'>Cheetos</b> in your hair.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thanks. (Eats it)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow. (Leaves)<br>
[Continued from earlier. In the game]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, I said, not now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah I know, I'm just a little concerned about you-<br>
<i>Penny</i>I said, not now. (Slays him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(From the beheaded head) Okay, maybe later.

<i>Raj</i>Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, what's with him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny's been keeping him up at night.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Me too. (Raj looks at him) But probably in a different way.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's gotten really hooked on "Age of Conan." She's playing non-stop.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, yes, online gaming addiction. There's nothing worse than having that multiplayer <b title="a monkey on sb's back - a serious problem that will not go away">monkey on your back</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, wake up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Danger, danger.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Afternoon, men. Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yeah, well, your attempt to <b title='juvenile - childish'>juvenilizing</b> me by excluding me from the set of adult males just- Oh, I'm too tired to do this.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>She comes into my room. No one's supposed to be in my room.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Well, I would <b title='suggest, assume'>postulate</b> she's escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I do that too. But probably in a different way.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's not what she's doing, Leslie. She's just trying to <b title='support'>shore up</b> her self-esteem. It's nothing to do with sex.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Everything has to do with sex.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Mm. <b title='make a formal statement of what is true'>Testify</b>. (Try to high five with her)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I'm not touching <b title='↗masturbate'>that</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leslie, you are way <b title='mistaken'>off base</b> here.<br>

<i>Leslie</i>Thank you. My point is that <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkerbell">Wiki</a>]'>Tinkerbell</b> just needs to get some.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll <b title='↗take a bullet for sb'>take the bullet</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, this whole idea's insane.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Enough debate. I'm going to take action. (To a guy sitting at next table) Excuse me. Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?<br>
<i>Guy</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Would you like to be?<br>
<i>Guy</i>Uh... Sure, why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yip, yip, yip. Can I have your phone number?<br>
<i>Guy</i>(Sizes Sheldon up) Uh... Yeah. Yeah. (Grabs Sheldon's hand and starts to write down his number)<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Chosen by science.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They may claim to use <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_algorithm">Wiki</a>]'>heuristic algorithms</b>, but it may well be <b title='nonsense'>hokum</b>.<br>
