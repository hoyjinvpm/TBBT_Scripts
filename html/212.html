<i>Sheldon</i>Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?<br>
<i>Raj</i>As with my father, I both love and fear it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All right, enough <b title='small talk'>chitchat</b>. Let's destroy something.<br>
<i>All</i>(Lift it up from the coffee table and put it on the floor) One, two, three. Unh.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, what shall be first to taste the <b title='extreme anger'>wrath</b> of Monte?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe we should start small.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay. Oh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what's inside the <b title='a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball">Wiki</a>]'>Magic 8 Ball</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did it when I was 4. It's an <b title='icosahedron - a polyhedron having 20 faces'>icosahedral</b> die floating in <b title='tint - slightly change the color of sth'>tinted</b> blue water.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Man, call <b title='a message or report that is intended to ruin the surprising part of a popular movie, book etc'>spoiler</b> alert before you say things like that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How about the toaster oven?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What did the toaster oven ever do to you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What did I do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. (To the oven) Sorry, you little nerd. You were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Gentlemen, goggles.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, this is an <b title='showing signs of future success, favorable, promising'>auspicious</b> moment. Like <b title='If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Oppenheimer">Wiki</a>]'>Robert Oppenheimer</b> or <b title='"That&#039;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong">Wiki</a>]'>Neil Armstrong</b>, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.<br>
<i>Raj</i>How about, "Die, toaster, die"?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That'll do it.<br>
(Monte moves and then erases, terminates, and smashes the unlucky oven)<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right, what's next?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(On the staircase) No, I think I'm just gonna stay in tonight and do laundry. (Monte storms out; she screams and runs away)
<s>The hallway. Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, yeah. This door got the full monty.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard? Uh-huh? What the hell?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A killer robot. We built it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, well, it almost killed me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, who exactly does it wanna kill?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League <b title='a competition in which every player or team plays against every other player or team'>round robin</b> <b title='a sports event that people and teams can take part in only if they receive an invitation'>Invitational</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Deadpan) You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's a big deal, heh. There's an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you'd like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You'd be the only <b title='do - have sex'>doable</b> girl.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're a pig, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How is doable anything but a compliment?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, why don't we just work on the robot?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and l have begun our little <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango">Wiki</a>]'>tango</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Our- Our tango?<br>
<i>Howard</i>The <b title='of the body ↗physical, mental'>carnal</b> <b title='conversation that consists of quick, witty comments and replies'>repartee</b>, the erotic to and fro. But, as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to <b title='stop resisting ↗surrender'>succumb</b> and eat the <b title='the main dish of a meal'>entrée</b> while it's still... (Mimcs <b title='sizzle - make the sound of food frying in hot oil'>sizzling</b>) hot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm begging you, stop talking.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, normally, I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it. You're a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's peculiar.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. You think you're some sort of <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_criminal">Smooth Criminal</a>]'>smooth-talking</b> <b title='a man who the ladies love, easy to talk to, or love being around'>ladies man</b>, but the truth is you are just pathetic and creepy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Um... So what are you saying?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It is not sexy to stare at my ass and say: (Mimics him) "Ooh, it must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that." And most important, we are not dancing a tango. We're-we're not to-ing and fro-ing. Nothing is ever gonna happen between us. <b title='used for emphasis'>Ever</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait a minute. This isn't flirting. You're serious.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you. No woman is ever gonna flirt with you. You're just gonna grow old and die alone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks for the <b title='warning'>heads-up</b>. (Takes off his goggles and starts to leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, where are you going?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm going home, to live my creepy, pathetic life.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, someone had to say it.<br>
(Raj whispers something into Leonard's ear; Leonard chuckles)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, he said maybe we should enter you in the killer-robot competition. (Raj and Leonard smirk and then stop, noticing Penny glaring at them)
<s>Howard's bedroom. He's lying on the bed, dejectedly.</s>
(Phone Ringing)<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, the phone is ringing!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Here's a crazy idea, Ma: answer it!<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>(On phone) Hello? All right, hold on. (To him) It's your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you're not at school today.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't go to school, Ma. I work at a university.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>That's a school. Now pick up the phone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't wanna talk to anybody.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't have homework. I'm a grown man with a Master's degree in Engineering!<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Excuse me, <b title='sb who is dressed fancy or act in a fancy matter'>Mr. Fancy Pants</b>. Want me to get you a <b title='a water-based frozen snack [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popsicle">Wiki</a>]'>popsicle</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Cherry, please.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>I ate the cherry. All that's left is green.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You make me wanna kill myself.<br>
[Cut to the cafeteria.]<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Now they're just yelling about popsicles. Sounds like Penny really <b title='get to - make sb feel annoyed or upset'>got to</b> him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about <b title='"There once was a man from Nantucket" is the opening line for many limericks, in which the name of the island of Nantucket creates obscene rhymes and puns. The protagonist is typically portrayed as a well-endowed, hypersexualized person. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_once_was_a_man_from_Nantucket">Wiki</a>]'>men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave</b>, but he does it with real sensitivity.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the <b title='an ionized state of matter similar to a gas [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)">Wiki</a>]'>plasma</b> lab is you built a robot?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, we did, Kripke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>His name is Monte.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Well, if you have any <b title='↗illusion'>delusions</b> about entering him against my robot, the Kripke <b title='↗cripple, Terminator, Eraser'>Crippler</b> in the Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational <b title='also know as'>aka</b> the SCRFLRRl, his name is gonna be <b title='waste or unwanted articles'>Scrap</b> Metal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on. Is that really necessary?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I believe it is. This is <b title='talk trash - complain, criticize, insult'>trash talk</b>. Trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. (Clears throat and stands up) Kripke, your robot is inferior, and it will be defeated by ours, because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I<b title='tend to'>'m given to</b> understand that your mother is <b title='↗fat, big, huge, chubby, thin, slender, slim, skinny'>overweight</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, <b title='an exclamation of surprise or disappointment'>snap</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, of course if that is a result of a <b title='relating to the glands'>glandular</b> condition and not <b title='laziness'>sloth</b> and <b title='the bad habit of eating and drinking too much'>gluttony</b>, I withdraw that comment.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What difference does it make? Fat is fat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There are boundaries.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Tell you what, forget the SCRFLRRl. Let's settle this roboto a roboto.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Barry</i>There's no guarantee we're gonna go against each other in the round robins, so let's <b title='throw down a challenge'>throw down</b>. You know, unless you're afraid.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Tomorrow, 3:00, the <b title='the study of motion and its causes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetics_(physics)">Wiki</a>]'>kinetics</b> lab.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Make it so.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, don't make it so. Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow. Our engineer is <b title='unable to live normally, or to do ordinary things'>incapacitated</b>.<br>
<i>Barry</i>What's wrong with him?<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and can't get girls.<br>
<i>Barry</i>We're all pathetic and creepy and can't get girls. That's why we fight robots. If you're not there, you'll be exposed to <b title='laugh at'>ridicule</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm curious, what part of America is that accent from?

<s>The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, you got a minute?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, come on in. What's up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I need you to apologize to Howard-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Get out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then have the robot go and get him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The robot didn't hurt his feelings.<br>
<i>Penny</i>His feelings needed to be hurt.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's been in bed for two days.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, probably with a <b title='a type of sex toy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blow-up_doll">Wiki</a>]'>blow-up doll</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's not with a- Does it really matter who or what he's with? The- The guy is <b title='feeling extremely shocked and sad'>devastated</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, please. How could I possibly devastate Howard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, don't take this as a criticism, but you do kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's that mean?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know. Like, most of the time, you're the easygoing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Banner#Bruce_Banner">Wiki</a>]'>Bruce Banner</b>. But then when you get angry, you kind of turn into like, you know: (Growls)<br>
<i>Penny</i>I turn into a bear?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind. Just- Please, just, go talk to him.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, and say what? That I didn't mean it? Because I meant it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, maybe you can <b title='do'>go at</b> it from a different angle. Like, um, you see <b title='a small sign of'>a glimmer of</b> goodness in him, and you only said what you said because you want to <b title='encourage the growth of'>nurture</b> it and make it shine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, pbbt!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, let's try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back? And he was 9 feet tall and he took my pants off and you said- What was that? What did you say? Oh, yes. You said you owed me one.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, come on, that's not fair.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I came home with no pants.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine. I'll go over there tomorrow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. I should probably give you a heads-up about his mother.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What about her?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's a delightful woman. You'll love her.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, there's a blond girl, Patsy, here to see you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Who?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't wanna talk to her.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters) Hey.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ma.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, I just <b title='↗drop by, stop by'>came by</b> to see how you were doing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm fine.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good. Your mom seems nice.<br>
<i>Howard</i>People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, Howard, I just want to, apologize. (No response) For some things that I have said. (Still no response) About you. I've been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I'm sorry. Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine. You're sorry. Goodbye.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, you're okay?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I'm a big boy. I'm not <b title='traumatize - shock badly'>traumatized</b> by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, <b title='You can use it to say to sb who is too self indulgent. You can also use it to say to sb who is over-opinionated and tries to enforce their opinion on you, perhaps arrogant.

<i>Penny</i>Okay. Well, bye. (Leaves. Howard closes the door and sobs) So close (Enters again).
<s>The living room.</s>
(Crashing on computer)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?<br>
<i>Barry</i>(On computer) As you can see, the Crippler is reducing the <b title='a compact automobile [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Cavalier">Wiki</a>]'>Chevy Cavalier</b> to <b title='broken pieces'>rubble</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't watch anymore.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, we have to <b title='call off - cancel'>call it off</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We don't have that option. We've accepted the challenge. We can't run away from a fight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, please. We've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What- Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You are overlooking the fact we know what we're up against. And we can modify Monte so that he's prepared.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me, but how are we gonna make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not yet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have faith, gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz. Engineering is merely the <b title='not clever'>slow</b> younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
<s>Howard's bedroom. Penny and he are sitting on his bed.</s>
<i>Howard</i>And then when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her <b title='Dental braces [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_braces">Wiki</a>]'>braces</b> off, but they left a little of the <b title='a lower jaw being too far behind the upper jaw or a misalignment of the teeth [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite">Wiki</a>]'>overbite</b>. It was so hot. Like a sexy little <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipmunk">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Tamia_striatus_eating-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Tamia_striatus_eating.jpg/220px-Tamia_striatus_eating.jpg">'>chipmunk</b>. I didn't have the courage, to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth-grade talent show.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw, that sounds sweet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Sings to the tune of "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_girl">Wiki</a>]'>My Girl</b>") Marcy Grossman is sunshine / On a cloudy day / When it's cold outside / Marcy Grossman is the month of May<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, it's cute.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I guess you'd say / What can make me feel this way? / Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman / Talking about Marcy<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's great.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Grossman<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ha, it' s fun.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to 10th grade.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Scoffs) Look at me. What chance do I have if I don't try too hard?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you have a terrific chance. I mean, you're smart, you're funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, look, <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, I've known you for like a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him. He's a nice guy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You really think so?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, I do. (Chuckles)<br>
(Heartbeat pounding in slow motion. We see a close-up of Howard's mouth, Penny's dilated eye, and her fist)
<s>The kinetics lab.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Nice little <b title='robot ↗android'>bot</b> you've got here.<br>
<i>Barry</i>I'm aware.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's this do, spin?<br>
<i>Barry</i>Yep. At <b title='revolutions per minute'>3400</b> rpm. It can cut through steel like it was rubber.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Neat. Good work. (Goes back to the guys) Sheldon, we've gotta call this off.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, Leonard. For years, merciless <b title='a violent man ↗villian, bully'>thugs</b> like Kripke have made my life a series of painful <b title="noogie - when sb rubs their knuckles back and forth against the top of sb's head, very hard.">noogies</b>, and humiliating <b title='when sb&#039;s underwear or other garments are wedged between the buttocks. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedgie">Wiki</a>]'>wedgies</b>, and the insensitively named <b title='a prank done by grasping the victim&#039;s forearm firmly in both hands, and then twisting the hands in opposite directions about the victim&#039;s arm, causing the tender skin to stretch, making it red and sore. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_burn#Indian_or_Chinese_burn">Wiki</a>]'>Indian burns</b>. Well, that stops now.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw: Overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's not overconfidence. That's observation.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. (To Barry) Kripke. I would ask if your robot is prepared to <b title='go to heaven, die'>meet its maker</b>, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.<br>
<i>Barry</i>What is his problem?<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='used to show approval'>Way to</b> <b title='use'>bust out</b> the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi">Wiki</a>]'>Jedi</b> <b title='↗thought control, brainwash, telepathy'>mind tricks</b>, dude.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I just wanna make sure that we're all clear. Standard Robotic Fighting League rules apply.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Are you crazy? This is a street fight. The street has no rules.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's right, Leonard. The <b title='model, pattern'>paradigm</b> is to the death.<br>
<i>Barry</i>I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my superiority now, and offer me your robot as the <b title='the benefits that sb gets when they win sth'>spoils</b> of war.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Never. I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.<br>
<i>Barry</i>That could be easily arranged. Ready, set, go?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do it.<br>
<i>Barry</i>All right, then. Ready, set, go.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, Sheldon, you got this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>lndeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. (Barry Kripke lights a torch) That's new.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Run, Monte, run.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Run, Monte.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Go, go, go, go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't hurt us, don't hurt us.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did this. Monte was killed by my <b title='arrogance'>hubris</b> and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No one's arguing with you, dude.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Storms in with Penny in tow) I got your text. How bad is? Oh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Forget the robot. What happened to you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>He slipped and fell.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes. Now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. The sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, what do you think, Howard? It-it's not that bad, right?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, no. A little <b title='insulating tape [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_tape">Wiki</a>]'>electrical tape</b>, some <b title='a fusible metal alloy used to join together metal workpieces [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder">Wiki</a>] ↗weld'>solder</b>, are you insane? I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're right. Monte's gone. We'll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I'll speak. Leonard, you'll play your <b title='large violin'>cello</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little <b title='carry away - move/excite greatly'>carried away</b>? I mean, it's just a toy robot.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(On the verge of a nervous breakdown ) Just a toy robot? (Runs into his bedroom and slams the door)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know, I got it. Sheldon? I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, don't get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity sex.
