<i>Penny</i>I'm going out tonight / I'm feeling all right / Going to let it all hang out / Wanna mak some noise / Really raise my voice / Yeah, I wanna scream and shout (Sees Sheldon) Good morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, (Turns off the player) while I <b title='agree with'>subscribe to</b> the "many worlds" theory which <b title='posit - suggest/assume'>posits</b> the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that none of them am I dancing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you fun in any of them?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The math would suggest that a few I'm a clown made of candy. But I don't dance.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. You want some <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_toast">Wiki</a>]'>French toast</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatmeal">Wiki</a>]'>oatmeal</b> day.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Tell you what, next French toast day, I will make you oatmeal.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dear lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Morning.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry I haven't given her your schedule yet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's an <b title='a personal calendar application made by Apple Inc. that runs on both the OS X desktop operating system and iOS mobile operating system [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_%28Mac_OS%29">Wiki</a>]'>iCal</b> download. She can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you'd have your <b title='a private meeting between a prisoner and his or her wife or husband, during which they are allowed to have sex'>conjugal visits</b> in her apartment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We did, but there were <b title='facts or reasons which make you feel that it was reasonable for sb to break the usual rules'>extenuating circumstances</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I see. Did her <b title='terrible'>abysmal</b> housekeeping skills finally <b title='win against'>trump</b> her <b title='perky - confident, happy, and active'>perkiness</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, her bed kind of... broke.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That doesn't seem likely. Her bed's of sturdy construction. Even the addition of a second normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure, much less a <b title='a very small human'>homunculus</b> such as yourself.<br>
<i>Penny</i>A homunculus?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Perfectly formed miniature human being.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you're my little homunculus. (Hugs him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't do that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I want oatmeal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know what, I give up. He's <b title='behaving in a very unreasonable and annoying way'>impossible</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, "I give up, he's <b title='and slightly strange'>improbable</b>."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm just saying, <b title='It is easier to get what you want by flattering people and being polite to them than by making demands'>you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can catch even more flies with <b title='animal feces'>manure</b>. What's your point?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's a-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='uses as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, that <b title='used for emphasis'>does</b> smell good. Too bad it's Monday. (Throws it into a trash can)
<s>The living room. They are having dinner.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband's name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know. What are the odds? Oh.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Easily calculable. We begin by identifying a set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless for example. Next we look at the-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon. It's an amazing coincence. Can we leave it at that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. Oh, Penny, It's as if <b title='A distributor of cheesecakes in the United States. It is also a restaurant company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cheesecake_Factory">Wiki</a>]'>Cheesecake Factory</b> is run by witches.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, you guys, let it go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine, whatever. (To Sheldon) Are you finished?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, yeah, sure. (He puts a piece of chocolate in her mouth) Thanks. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What was that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It does. But in my experience, you don't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='Hamlet Act 1, scene 5, 159–167 [<a href="http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/there-more-things-heaven-earth-horatio">Wiki</a>] philosophy - a particular system of beliefs, values and principles'>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</b><br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah yeah. Now that's you, <b title='very offensive, unpleasant, or rude'>obnoxious</b> and insufferable.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Enters, wearing a strange costume, with Raj in tow) What's going on, <b title='↗The Eloi are one of the two post-human races in H. G. Wells&#039;s 1895 novel The Time Machine. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloi">Wiki</a>]'>day dwellers</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, man, did the <b title='the official fan club for the American rock band Kiss [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Army">Wiki</a>]'>KISS Army</b> <b title='officially end, ↗abolish, revoke, withdraw'>repeal</b> "don't ask, don't tell"?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. Raj and I are going to a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture">Wiki</a>]'>goth</b> club in Hollywood To hang with the night people. Anybody wanna <b title='go somewhere with sb'>come along</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no. I'm going out like this... (Takes off his coat)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, what did you do?<br>
<i>Howard</i>They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. Yeah, I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. (Rajs takes off his jacket) Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some <b title='weird'>freaky</b> girl<b title='with her labia and/or clitoris pierced'> with her business pierced</b>, take them off, I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nightclub.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bazinga! None of you ever see my <b title='↗prank'>practical jokes</b> coming, do you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, how about you two? Look, I got some extra <b title='tatto'>tat</b> sleeves.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why are you carrying extras?<br>
<i>Howard</i>In case I <b title='damage sth by getting it stuck on sth sharp'>snag</b> one on someone's nipple ring.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, yeah, I think we'll <b title='refuse to accept sth'>pass</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, is the Mrs speaking for the couple now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>In this case, you bet she is. (Raj whispers something in Howard's ear)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, she's <b title='extremely determined to get what you want, even if it annoys other people'>pushy</b>, and yes, he's <b title="extremely obedient to one's girlfriend. also pussy-whipped">whipped</b>, But that's not the expression.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, I wanna stop at <b title='the largest drug retailing chain in the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walgreens">Wiki</a>]'>Walgreens</b> and pick up some more eyeliner.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They're gonna get <b title='beat up - beat hard'>beaten up</b> at that club.<br>
<i>Penny</i>They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon. I almost sat in your spot.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did you? I didn't noce. Have a chocolate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you.
<s>A goth nightclub.</s>
<i>Raj</i>I think we're fitting in quite nicely.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's so gothic about vodka and <b title='曼越橘; 小红莓 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry">Wiki</a>]'>cranberry</b> juice?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hello? It looks like blood. Did you even read the <b title='a web-based and wiki-based community, consisting of an extensive database of how-to guides. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiHow">Wiki</a>]'>wikiHow</b> link I sent you on being goth?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, I'm <b title='late in paying money or completing work'>behind</b> in my wiki-reading. I'm kind of on a <b title='an American lawyer, politician, and author, best known for his popular legal thrillers. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grisham">Wiki</a>]'>John Grisham</b> <b title='thrill, feeling of pleasure'>kick</b> right now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I finished reading <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pelican_Brief">Wiki</a>]'>The Pelican Brief</b>, and loved it so much, I <b title='dive into - involve oneself completely in'>dived right into</b> the client. He was a lawyer himself, so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. (To two girls sitting next to him) Can you pass the <b title='a type of snack mix that includes Chex breakfast cereal (sold by General Mills) as a major component. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chex_Mix">Wiki</a>]'>Chex Mix</b> please? Thank you. We are lost boys.<br>
<i>Girl #1</i>Good for you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm actually much more lost than he is.<br>
<i>Girl #2</i>Nice ink.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?<br>
<i>Girl #1</i>Two light beers.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Light beers. Well, wiki how about that?<br>
<i>Girl #2</i>What's your names?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm Howard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Raj.<br>
<i>Girl #1</i>I'm Bethany.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nice to meet you, Bethany.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes, very nice.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>Nice to meet you, too.<br>
<i>Girl #2</i>I'm Sarah. Not that anyone cares.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
<s>The living room. Leonard, Penny, and Sheldon are watching TV.</s>
<i>Penny</i>What's this cartoon called again?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='A fictional anime referenced in popular US TV shows "Two And A Half Men" and "The Big Bang Theory". (Both sitcoms written by Chuck Lorre)'>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not a cartoon. It's <b title='a type of Japanese animated movie that often shows a lot of violence or sex'>anime</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically <b title='wind up - end up'>wound up</b> with three.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're here a lot now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip. (Mimes zipping her mouth)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. Chocolate?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes please. (Her phone rings) Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I... (Sheldon sighs) You know what, hold on. Let me take this in the hall. (Sheldon mouths "Chocolate?" Penny mouths "Thanks" and takes one) You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I know what you're doing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, you're using chocolates as positive <b title='the act of making sth stronger'>reinforcement</b> for what you consider correct behavior.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very good. Chocolate?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I don't want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can't train my girlfend like a lab rat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, turns out I can.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you shouldn't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ <b title=' a type of learning in which an individual&#039;s behavior is modified by its antecedents and consequences [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning">Wiki</a>]'>operant conditioning</b> techniques, building on the works of Thorndike and B.F.Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, this has to stop now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the "bazinga" was implied. We're just tweaking her personality, <b title='sand - make a surface smooth by rubbing it with sandpaper or using a special piece of equipment'>sanding</b> off the rough edges, if you will.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. You're not sanding Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you saying that I am forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid <b title='a set of rules that are followed when doing a scientific experiment or giving someone medical treatment'>protocol</b> that will make our lives better?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. You're fordden.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bad Leonard. (Squirts water at him)
<s>The nightclub.</s>
<i>Bethany</i>So, what do you guys do?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Goth food.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>What's goth food?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Blackened salmon?<br>
<i>Bethany</i>No, I meant what do you do for jobs?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, we're scientists.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>What are the dark sciences?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I am an <b title='astrophysics - the scientific study of the chemical structure of the stars and the forces that influence them'>astrophysicist</b>, And a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='an exclamation of dismay or exasperation like "woe is me" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oy_vey">Wiki</a>]'>Oy vay</b>.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>That sounds really cool.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Does it? Okay.If you like space stuff, I design components for the International Space Station, which is in space. Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, what do you <b title='gal - girl/woman'>gals</b> do?<br>
<i>Bethany</i>I work at the <b title='a chain of retail clothing stores [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap">Wiki</a>]'>GAP</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really? How about that? I've been to the GAP.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I've been there, as well. I like your T-shirts with the little pocket.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>I work there, too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>Yeah, why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure, we like fun.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We are fun people.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Dark and fun.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>Come on. I know a place you'll really <b title='like'>dig</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did you bring the black condoms?<br>
<i>Raj</i>In my <b title='bottom, buttocks'>fanny</b> pack.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let's go.
<s>A tattoo parlor. Bethany is getting a tattoo.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Are you happy now?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not particularly.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh my god, she didn't!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What could she possibly be talking about for so long?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. "Bazinga." You know, using positive reinforcemt techniques, I could train that behavior out of her in a week.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're not squirting her in the face with water.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, of course not. We're talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Forget it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, come on. You can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not. Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're not changing how Penny laughs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, that would be <b title='seeming strange when considered together with other aspects of a situation'>incongruous</b>. Now I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing <b title='range of a human voice or a musical instrument'>register</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sorry, guys. That girl is freaky.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Come again?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Freaky.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Freaky?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, freaky.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have a chocolate.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you.
<s>The parlor. Howard is about to get a tatto.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Are you seriously going to <b title='spoil the surface or appearance of sth'>deface</b> your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh... Yeah!<br>
<i>Raj</i>What is your mother going to say?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She's not gonna see it. She <b title='How to take a oral/rectal/axillary (armpit) temperatue [<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Temperature">Wiki</a>]'>takes my temperature orally now</b>.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>What are you gonna get, Howard?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, I can't really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull, or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog">Wiki</a>]'>Kermit the Frog</b>.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>Kermit the Frog?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know. (Mimes the puppet) Hello, I'm on Howard's butt.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>Get the mean little skull, And I'll see if I can make him smile.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>What are you gonna get, Raj?<br>
<i>Raj</i>With my luck, <b title='a serious disease of the liver [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis">Wiki</a>]'>hepatitis</b>.<br>
<i>Man</i>Okay, here we go. (Howard squirms and whines) That's just rubbing alcohol.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know, but it was cold.<br>
<i>Man</i>I'm putting on the <b title='a design made on sth using a stencil (a thin piece of metal, plastic or card with a design cut out of it)'>stencil</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What-what comes after the stencil?<br>
<i>Man</i>This.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, that's it. No needle. No pain. No tattoo.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>What's the big deal? You've done this before.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I haven't. Look. I'm sorry. I'm a <b title='sb who deceives others'>fraud</b>. He's a fraud.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We're both frauds.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, I think I covered that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But I was summing up.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We're not goth. We're just... Guys.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Very, very smart guys.<br>
<i>Bethany</i>So you were totally <b title='scam - cheat, swindle'>scamming</b> us?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. And I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless, of course, our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive Huh? Anything?<br>
<i>Bethany</i>I'm leaving.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>I'm leaving, too. Not that anyone cares.<br>
<i>Raj</i>When we tell this story, let's end it differently.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical <b title='a piece of music'>number</b>?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then <b title='go to bed'>turn in</b>. I <b title='hope'>trust</b> if you two are planning on engaging in <b title='showing or concerning sexual love ↗coitus, sexual intercourse'>amorous</b> activities, You'll keep the <b title='dB [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">Wiki</a>]'>decibel</b> level to a minimum?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. (Throws a piece of chocolate, and Penny catches it using her mouth)<br>
<i>Penny</i>These are so good.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Unbelievable.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I-I was just thinking we should probably turn in, too.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, you know, my new bed got delivered. If you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? That's a lot of work, and it's kinda late.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have tbe quiet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let's go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behavior. I wonder if anyone else has <b title='stumble on - find or discover sth by chance =come across'>stumbled onto</b> that.
<s>Raj's car.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, wait. How about this? We say there were four goth girls. The two girls in the club had two friends.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their goth-like nature?<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's that got to do with the story?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Engaging my <b title='connected with the sense of smell'>olfactory</b> sense helps make it real for me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine, they smelled good.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, they did. Like jasmine and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeysuckle">Wiki</a>]'>honeysuckle</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whatever.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And then they held hands and did a sexy, <b title='relating to a demon'>demonic</b> <b title='a dance [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokey_cokey">Wiki</a>]'>hokey pokey</b> for us.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no. Look, let me just say my story all the way through and then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm sorry. Go on.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. We got tattoos, And then the four girls took us to their place.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But we do't have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We say they're in a very intimate area.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, we're bad boys, aren't we?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Right, right. So, we go back to their place and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But we just got tatts. Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?<br>
<i>Howard</i>True. Okay. Forget the hot tub. The point is, we each had a <b title='ménage à trois - a sexual relationship between three people'>ménage</b> with sexy goth girls.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow. What a great night.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. Hey, you wanna try a country bar tomorrow night?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Maybe we'll <b title='have sex'>get lucky</b> with some sexy cowgirls.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Could happen.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I wonder how they smell.<br>
