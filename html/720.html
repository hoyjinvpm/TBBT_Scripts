<i>Leonard</i>I gotta tell you, the more I read about the <b title="formed when the Earth or universe began">primordial</b> gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Only without the sex.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, literally, none of it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What do you think about it, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Meh.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist. What I'd like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who-who's looking out for <b title="the average male ↗an ordinary/average/regular Joe">Joe Six-pack</b> and all his quantum physics concerns?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, my God, you're jealous.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I be jealous?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I don't know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson'>Wiki</a>]">Higgs field</b> just got proven, and you've been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it than when you started.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, well, I've had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the <b title="Hadron Collider (LHC) [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider'>Wiki</a>]">Hadwon Cowwider</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?<br>
<i>Barry</i>No, but they did find evidence that you'll bewieve anything.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would you do that? You're a string theorist as well.<br>
<i>Barry</i>Incowwect. I am a stwing <b title="pragmatic - dealing with problems in a sensible, practical way instead of strictly following a set of ideas">pwagmatist</b>. I say I'm gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on <b title="liquor">wiquor</b> and <b title="broad - female">bwoads</b>. <b title="later">Water</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Do you think he's right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, you're up early.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I couldn't sleep.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I told you those <b title="a TV series [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)'>Wiki</a>]">Walking Dead</b> pillowcases were a bad idea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, that's not it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is something bothering you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but you wouldn't understand.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, come on, try me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. I've devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for <b title="the 'curling up' of extra dimensions in string theory">the compactification of extra dimensions</b>. I've got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the <b title="constant idle talk">jibber jabber</b> in the middle, but I know what it's like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean your acting career?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your relationship with Leonard?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your failed attempt to go back to college?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. I'm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it's like to be in one and realize it's never gonna turn out the way you want.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I said Leonard, you said no.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm talking about other guys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Well, what do you do?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know if I can do that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know it's hard, honey, but in the end, that's how you grow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, how's dating two women going?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn't the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And?<br>
<i>Raj</i>She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily's the best. Why can't you be more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?<br>
<i>Raj</i>At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why the rush? She isn't going anywhere.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She is. But I like that attitude.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're really going to do this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I'm going through is essentially a breakup. And according to <b title="a magazine for women [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_(magazine)'>Wiki</a>]">Cosmopolitan</b> magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're reading Cosmo?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. As it turns out, there's an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that's just a doodle of a <b title="hyper- - over; above; beyond; elliptic - of, relating to, or having the shape of an ellipse">hyperelliptic</b> <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface'>Wiki</a>]">Riemann surface</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's going to be okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can't keep <b title="postulate - claim or imagine that sth is true or that it exists">postulating</b> multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too. (Storms off)<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Glances at his watch) So, you and Emily still together?
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>I spoke to Bernadette. She's free tomorrow night.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, okay, great. But if we're really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Like when it turns out she's made of rubber, I don't say anything?<br>
<i>Raj</i>She's very real.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, that's what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.<br>
<i>Raj</i>See? This is exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about you saying in front of her.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I promise I'll be on my best behavior.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You got it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No jokes about the year I took ballet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You took ballet?<br>
<i>Raj</i>God, you never listen.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you sure you wanna do this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about your old look, well-groomed <b title="ventriloquism - the ability to speak without moving your lips so that your voice seems to be coming from sb/sth else, usu as a way of entertaining people [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriloquism'>Wiki</a>]">ventriloquist</b> doll?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll) Oh my God, I do look like that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You stop it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, how do you want me to cut it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, how about Bill Gates meets <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla'>Wiki</a>]">Nikola Tesla</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, business in the front, science in the back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Or I don't cut it and maybe just style it a little.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I'm in your hands. Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's ten <b title="outstanding, superb">dynamite</b> tips to enjoy your PMS.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Can you keep him quiet? Maybe <b title="make a noise by hitting small metal objects against each other">jangle</b> some keys in front of him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That doesn't work any more. He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor. So, now that you're no longer <b title="If you invest time or energy in something, you spend a lot of time or energy on something that you consider to be useful or likely to be successful.">invested</b> in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn't really understand it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't feel bad. Neither does he.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, what do you think?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It actually looks good, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Doesn't it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I'd be the dreamy one and the smart one.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sorry I'm late. What did you do?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I gave him a new look. It's cute, huh?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem. I don't need other girls to see him walking around like <b title="sb considered to be very sexually attractive">sex on a stick</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's right. I'm too hot.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm excited to meet Emily.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Me too. I just hope he doesn't blow it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Why would you say that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Because he's Raj, that's his thing. <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend_It_Like_Beckham'>Wiki</a>]">Beckham can bend it</b>, <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph'>Wiki</a>]">Ralph can wreck it</b>, Raj can blow it. Look, I don't want it to happen, but odds are he's gonna find a way to- Oh, crap, I know that girl.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>How?<br>
<i>Howard</i>In a bad way, very bad.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.
<s>Later.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Have we met before?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, no. I, I don't, I don't think so.<br>
<i>Emily</i>You sure? You look familiar.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, you sure don't. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Did you go to that <b title="indoor cycling [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_cycling'>Wiki</a>]">spin class</b> on Green Street?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That must be it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Since when do you go to spin class?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow. Now who doesn't listen?
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, your food's getting cold. What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children's party while I was in Texas?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait. What's wrong with geology?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_Up_with_the_Kardashians'>Wiki</a>]">the Kardashians</b> aren't real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you considered studying standard model physics?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You want me to give up string theory for something that's less advanced? You know, why don't you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Like you could get a brown bear.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, I've got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don't know.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a <b title="sth that people like or do for a short time, or that is fashionable for a short time">fad</b>, I'd get a <b title="a tattoo above sb's ass crack">tramp stamp</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about loop quantum gravity?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity's positively <b title="crazy or silly">loopy</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who's the duchess?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>One of the people that lives in his head.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I hope he's this <b title="very troubled in mind with grief or worry">distraught</b> if he ever breaks up with me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, if he does, I'll see if my bear has a friend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's actually not bad advice. You know, I didn't seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.<br>
<i>Amy</i>How does that happen?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex'>Wiki</a>]">cerebral cortex</b> is <b title="twiddle your thumbs - do nothing while you are waiting for sth to happen">twiddling</b> its <b title="as used in a proverb or other phrase; well known">proverbial</b> thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus?<br>
<i>Penny</i>And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
<s>The restaurant.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Emily, what do you do?<br>
<i>Emily</i>I'm a <b title="the part of medical science that deals with skin diseases and their treatment">dermatology</b> <b title="a stage of postgraduate medical training [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_(medicine)'>Wiki</a>]">resident</b> at Huntington Hospital.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone's skin's about to be softer than ever.<br>
<i>Emily</i>This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that's where you saw him.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Wow. That's amazing. What was that like?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you're-<br>
<i>Emily</i>Oh, my God, I remember.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can I finish my astronaut story?<br>
<i>Emily</i>It was four years ago.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please don't say it.<br>
<i>Emily</i>We were set up on a blind date.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please don't say it.<br>
<i>Emily</i>You came to my apartment.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're saying it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wh, what happened?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, what happened?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I'll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little <b title="slightly ill">funny</b>. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Please don't say it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.<br>
<i>Emily</i>You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn't have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Right, just water.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I'm glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.<br>
<i>Emily</i>It's fine. All my friends love this story. They call you <b title="[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla'>Wiki</a>]">Clogzilla</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, yeah, I get it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, hey, it's not like cotton candy comes out of you.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Come on, let's get you to bed. You've had a lot to drink.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No more than Penny.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That's what I'm saying.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. Empty room. Empty room. If somebody says come in, I'm gonna freak out.
<s>The restaurant.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?<br>
<i>Emily</i>I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You're kidding, right?<br>
<i>Raj</i>She's scary, but it's a cute scary.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, <b title="considering sth that happened in the past, using knowledge or information that you did not have at that time">in retrospect</b>, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I'd really appreciate it if we could move on.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howie, we moved on a long time ago.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm just saying-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>We moved on.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. Fine.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>How's your soup?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ah, it's all right. They could've filled the <b title="the part of an object such as a spoon, pipe, toilet etc that is shaped like a bowl">bowl</b> a little more. Excuse me.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Where are you going?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I need some fresh air.<br>
<i>Emily</i><b title='"I snuck out the window and never saw her again."'>Been there</b>.

<i>Howard</i>I wouldn't worry about it. He's got a pretty good sense of humor.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I hope so. What happened to you last night?<br>
