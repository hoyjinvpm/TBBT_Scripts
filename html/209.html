<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is shaking?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's <b title='used in conversation but not in formal speech or writing'>colloquial</b>. A conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's wrong with you? You're freaking me out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm <b title='strike up - begin'>striking up</b> a casual conversation with you. <b title="What's up">'Sup</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Please don't do that.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alright. But I'm <b title='be given to - be in the habit of'>given</b> to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more <b title='acceptable ↗plausible'>palatable</b> to preface it with <b title='trivial'>banal</b> <b title='small talk'>chitchat</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So this wasn't the awkward part?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. All right. 'Sup?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, feeling the awkward now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett. And she's a highly distinguished surgical <b title='a stage of graduate medical training [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_%28medicine%29">Wiki</a>]'>resident</b> at <b title='Fremont Memorial Hospital is a hospital in Yuba City, California'>Fremont Memorial</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, Leonard told me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>To you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. See, of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with, she's the only one I have ever found tolerable. (Penny is rendered speechless)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what about me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The statement stands for itself.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, aren't you <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Anyway, <b title='used to talk about sth that may possibly happen or be true'>should</b> you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You say that now, but consider the following scenario. You're sitting in your apartment. It's late. You're alone. Your <b title=' a portion of the brain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus">Wiki</a>]'>hypothalamus</b> is swimming in a soup of <b title='primary female sex hormones [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen">Wiki</a>]'>estrogen</b> and <b title='hormone involved in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis of humans and other species. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone">Wiki</a>]'>progesterone</b> and, suddenly, even Leonard seems like a <b title='↗workable, feasible, plausible'>viable</b> sexual candidate. Or a-a hookup, as it's referred to by today's urban youth.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your <b title='desire to have sex ↗lust'>libido</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I could think about you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Whatever works.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='goodbye'>Peace out</b>.
<s>The living room. Stephanie, Sheldon, and Leonard are having dinner.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mm. (Leonard forced a smile and so did Stephanie) This is very pleasant.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you said there would never be enough pasta for the three of us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I <b title='accept that I was mistaken'>stand corrected</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, ltalian housewives have a rule of thumb: A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person, as it doubles in volume when cooked.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>That's very interesting.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice. (Gets up and leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up. Ahem. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good. What's your favorite fruit?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>It, uh- Strawberries.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mm, technically <b title='not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry">Wiki</a>]'>not a fruit</b>, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Uh, Lawrence Memorial in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston">Wiki</a>]'>Galveston</b>, Texas.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? That's where I was born. (Leonard blows off the candles)<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>God, you're kidding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. It- When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>What? What happened?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own <b title='Computed axial tomography [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_axial_tomography">Wiki</a>]'>CAT</b> scanner.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>I'm sorry, you tried to build your own CAT scanner?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig">Wiki</a>]'>guinea pig</b>, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house: Not a Snowball's chance in a CAT scanner.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, Sheldon. (Motions him to go to the kitchen counter)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the Civil War have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? (At the counter) Look at that, there's even pasta leftover.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I do. Do you? Because, frankly, you've been <b title='in a very bad temper and likely to get angry'>in a foul mood</b> since I sat down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, here's my question: Why did you sit down?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What landing party?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_characters">List of Star Trek characters</a>]'>You're Kirk.</b> I'm Spock. Wolowitz is Scotty. Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed. And now we've got McCoy.
<s>A movie theater.</s>
<i>Stephanie</i>So, we're all standing around looking at the <b title='post operation'>post-op</b> X-ray and there it is, <b title='easy to see or understand'>clear as day</b>, right in the guy's chest cavity: One of my earrings.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh my God, what did you do?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>What do you think I did? I <b title='discreet - careful about what you say or do'>discreetly</b> slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket, and then got the hell out of there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I <b title='have sth to argue'>have a bone to pick</b> with you, sir.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Hi, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, but your <b title='sb you spend a lot of time with, Leonard in this case'>companion</b> left the most <b title='cipher - secret writing, code'>indecipherable</b> invitation.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What invitation?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"We're going to the movies." What movie? What theater? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn't have done a better job.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, clearly, I could have.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I'll find us seats.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Oh no. We have seats.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not the right seats.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ha! Ha! Ha!<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>What is he doing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's finding the acoustic <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_spot">Wiki</a>]'>sweet spot</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ha!<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Does he always do this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ho! Ho!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I am really sorry about this.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>No, it's fine, you know. He's sweet.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(After humming a tone) My apologies. You've been sitting in it <b title='from the very beginning'>all along</b>. Leonard, you wanna <b title='↗scooch, scooter'>slide over</b> one?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. Just sit here.<br>
(<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_note">Wiki</a>]'>THX's "Deep Note"</b> playing. Sheldon stays really, really close to leonard.)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yeah. This is it.
<s>Outside Leonard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Tell me what you see here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The <b title='any solid object used as a weapon'>blunt instrument</b> that will be the focus of my murder trial?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is Stephanie's Facebook page. Now, where it should say "in a relationship, " what does it say?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>"Stephanie Barnett is single."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who's Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's just her Facebook page, and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't see it, do you? We're losing her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, I'm gonna make this very simple for you. You, are not in this relationship. I, am. Ergo, you have noooo (shakes his hands) say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm afraid I can't <b title='agree sth is true'>allow</b> that. <b title='according to'>Pursuant</b> to Starfleet General Order 104, Section A, you are <b title='deem - consider ↗ponder'>deemed</b> unfit, and I hereby relieve you of your command.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Give me one good reason why not.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because this is not Star Trek! (Slams the door)<br>
[Penny's door]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny? Penny? Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is banana bread.<br>
<i>Penny</i>This is a door knob.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's my understanding that an <b title='not asked for and often not wanted'>unsolicited</b> gift of food can be a <b title='forerunner'>precursor</b> to an <b title='done without preparation or planning'>impromptu</b> invitation to come in and chat.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, would you like to come in?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I suppose I could <b title='be able to afford'>spare</b> a few minutes. (Hands her the bread; comes in, notices the mess; gasps) Were you robbed?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How can you be sure?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, what do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but, Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.<br>
<i>Penny</i>He's having problems with Stephanie?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the Internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Again, urban slang. In which I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.<br>
<i>Penny</i>We never got to the bedroom.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. All right. You know what? I'll tell you what happened. Ah. We were young. We were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a <b title='The Lake House is a 2006 American romantic drama [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lake_House_%28film%29">Wiki</a>]'>time-traveling mailbox</b> at my lake house.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships. (Raj and Howard look at each other)<br>
<i>Raj</i>You told me you were gonna have the talk with him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>More to the point, it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I don't think you can.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look at Leonard's record. Twenty-seven days with Joyce Kim. During which she defected to North Korea. Two <b title='booty call - a last-minute or previously unplanned request to meet up with sb with the intention of having sex'>booty calls</b> with Leslie Winkle. For which she awarded him the nickname <b title='↗Premature ejaculation (PE)'>Speed-of-Light</b> Leonard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And a three-hour dinner with Penny.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Which would've been two and a half if they ordered the <b title='a lightly baked cake [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souffl%C3%A9">Wiki</a>]'>soufflé</b> when they sat down.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Based on the <b title='also known as a geometric sequence. e. g. 54 18 6 2 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression">Wiki</a>]'>geometric progression</b>, his relationship with Stephanie should've ended after 20 minutes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, I'm aware of the math. Y equals 27 days over 12 <b title='The nth root of a number x is a number which, when raised to the power of n, equals x. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root">Wiki</a>]'>to the nth</b>. The issue remains. How do we <b title='avoid ↗circumference, circumcise'>circumvent</b> his inevitable rejection?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll tell you what you shouldn't do. Don't spray him some with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it? That doesn't work at all. No matter how much you put on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So that's all you've got? <b title='like the end of the world'>Apocalyptic</b> <b title='the murder of a whole race or group of people ↗suicide, pesticide, herbicide, homicide'>genocide</b> and "Go easy on the cologne"?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah.
<s>Penny's door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Knocks again) Penny. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini">Wiki</a>]'>Zucchini</b> bread.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>May I come in?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I see. Apparently, my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So have you and I returned to a social <b title='balanced state of mind, feelings etc ↗ultimatum'>equilibrium</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great. New topic.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Where are you in your menstrual cycle?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's- I've been doing some research online, and apparently, female primates- you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you. They find their mate more desirable when he's <b title=' try to win the affections, with a view to marriage'>courted</b> by another female. Now, this effect is intensified, when the rival female is <b title='secrete - produce a liquid substance'>secreting</b> the <b title='a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone">Wiki</a>]'>pheromones</b> associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question. Where are you-? (Penny slams the door) Clearly, I'm <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle">Wiki</a>]'>14 days</b> too early.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>All I'm saying is, if they can cure <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever">Wiki</a>]'>yellow fever</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria">Wiki</a>]'>malaria</b>, why can't they do something about <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance">Wiki</a>]'>lactose intolerance</b>?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Leonard, you're gonna have to let this go. You had a little <b title='A dip or dipping sauce is a common condiment for many types of food. Blue cheese dressing is a popular salad dressing and dip in the United States. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_cheese_dressing">Wiki</a>]'>cheese dip</b>, you farted. I thought it was cute.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, hi, Stephanie.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Want some more wine?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Yeah. I mean, I assume I'm not driving anywhere tonight. (Sheldon groans when they kisses)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a craving for white asparagus (Shows him a jar) that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied. (Grunts)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Mm-hm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Goes over to the kitchen counter at where Sheldon is) What is wrong with you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm helping you with Stephanie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>By making <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation">Constipation</a>]'>constipated</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose">Wiki</a>]'>moose</b> sounds?<br>

If the two of you then engage in <b title='sexual intercourse'>intercourse</b>, this will create the biochemical reaction which <b title='plural of "lay person (≠expert)" ↗layman'>lay people</b> naively interpret as falling in love.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Huh. Would it work if I just punched you in the face?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, actually, it would, but let's see how the lid goes. (Loudly) I'm not strong enough, Leonard. You'll have to do it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, God's sakes. (Snatches the jar) Go ahead, it's pre-loosened. (Leonard can't open it) (Grunts)<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Do you want some help with that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, no. I got it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yeah, yeah. He's got it, and that's not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the <b title='alplha beta gamma delta epsilon... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet">Wiki</a>]'>beta</b> male. (To Leonard) Open it. (Leonard bangs the jar against the kitchen counter and breaks it) Ow! Ow, ow!<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Oh, my God, are you okay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, no, I'm not- I'm bleeding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Stephanie) Like a gladiator.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stitches?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Mm-hm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>With a needle?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Well, yeah. I mean, just a few.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, okay. Yeah, hang on a sec. (Goes over to the sink and throws up)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.
<s>Stephanie's hospital.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Checking Leonard's hand) What a beautiful job Stephanie did. Yeah I might have gone with a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture#Placement">Wiki</a>]'>mattress suture</b> instead of a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket_stitch">Wiki</a>]'>blanket suture</b>, but you can't argue with her results. <b title='used when you wish a situation was different, and you feel sad or disappointed'>It's a shame</b> it won't scar. The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I did not burst into tears. My eyes just got a little watery.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Watery?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She stuck a needle into my hand.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Hey, how's my big crybaby?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't cry.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Okay, I'm just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it's all good. What do you say we get you home, put you to bed?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Are you still gonna spend the night?<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Uh, no. I think that you probably need to rest.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's right. As long as you're vomiting, <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b> is <b title='contraindicate - to not advise'>contraindicated</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you, Dr. Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Stephanie</i>Okay, I'm gonna go get your <b title='↗admit'>discharge</b> papers.<br>
(Sheldon clicks his tongue)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you. (Sighs)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Howard) Can you open this for me?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can I see your stitches?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. (Howard retches seeing the stitches)<br>

<i>Leonard</i>What for?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Your Facebook status update. "Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What? No. No, that's not right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Seriously? You went first after only two weeks? That's bold.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's not bold, it's a mistake. I didn't change my status.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, then who did?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I had no choice. He cried in front of her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You hacked my Facebook account?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, it's hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-El.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you insane? Now she's gonna think I'm desperate. You've destroyed this relationship. And, you wanna know the worst part? You don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in.<br>
