<s>A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles, Bernadette is washing her hands.</s>
<i>Amy</i>I must say, Penny, this is great fun.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Glad you're enjoying yourself.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on <b title='the process of getting rid of substances that your body no longer needs'>elimination</b>. Now they have a delightful social aspect.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Amy, you must've been in the bathroom with other women before.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed <b title='off-putting - tending to disconcert or repel'>off-put</b> when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Some women don't like to get <b title='very friendly'>chummy</b> when their panties are down.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You okay in there, <b title='best friend'>bestie</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm fine.<br>
<i>Amy</i>The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine-
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>She always this crabby when she urinates?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>We're really not that close.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='fuck it'>Screw it</b>. I'll go later.<br>
<i>Amy</i>And I'll be right by your side.
<s>A shoe shop.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's nice.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, it's not. It's a strategic maneuver. Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is <b title='cunning, sly'>crafty</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You think?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of <b title='gnu [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildebeest">Wiki</a>] ↗antelope'>wildebeests</b>? By going after its weakest member.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, what makes me the weakest member?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the <b title='a geographical region in Africa'>Serengeti</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Oh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>It doesn't matter. I'm gonna tell her we can't make it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, no. You have to go.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we're gonna use that to our advantage.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait. What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Amy</i>By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could <b title='discover sth by searching or asking questions thoroughly '>ferret out</b> Priya's tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard's no stranger to back-alley <b title='cockfight - a fight between two adult male chickens'>cockfights</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't know. I'm not a very good liar. They kinda <b title='=whip'>whup</b> that out of you in Catholic school.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't worry. I'll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I don't know you people. I'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my <b title=' an American oil retail brand'>Texaco</b> card.<br>
<i>Amy</i>How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your <b title='large in a way that is attractive or pleasant'>ample</b> bosom?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't want anything in my ample bosom.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, see you later.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good news. I finally <b title='get a handle on sth - start to understand a situation, subject etc'>have a handle on</b> my idea for three-person chess.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That is good news. Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional <b title='a flat shape with four straight sides ↗rectangle'>quadrilateral</b> to triangular <b title='tessellate - fit together in a pattern with no spaces in between'>tessellation</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That, that's brilliant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's what I do. But wait, there's more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When the serpent <b title='slither - slide somewhere over a surface, twisting or moving from side to side'>slithers</b> to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case, she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand <b title='↗emperor, empire, queen'>Empress</b>, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Elegant.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's because it's simple.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And a third person. It's three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should <b title='think deeply'>reflect</b> on that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Got it. Bye.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know I'm right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Outside apartment) I think he's getting worse.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, my <b title='Any of the bones of the metatarsus (part of the foot containing the five bones between the ankle and the toes)'>metatarsal</b> are <b title='bark - graze'>barking</b>. (Comes up the stairs wearing high heels)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You okay?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yeah, yeah. I'm just <b title='break in - train and discipline'>breaking in</b> some new shoes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Very pretty.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hadn't really thought about it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Look.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, sure. Very... prominent.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Please, Leonard, don't <b title=' look at sb in an unpleasant way that shows that you think they are sexually attractive'>leer</b>, you have a girlfriend.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Amy</i>So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. How did you know?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, 'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to <b title='leer'>ogle</b> my <b title='buttocks'>caboose</b> as I walk away.
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Priya</i>Hey, you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?<br>
<i>Raj</i>The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I'd rather get a <b title='rectal examination [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_examination">Wiki</a>]'>prostate exam</b> from a <b title='sb suffering from leprosy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy">Wiki</a>]'>leper</b> who walks away with nine fingers.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I have to feel sorry for myself. I'm the only one who cares. Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? In front of your sister?<br>
<i>Priya</i>We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Excuse me. I'm gonna go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot my <b title='a jacket which is made of a material which protects you from the wind [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windbreaker">Wiki</a>]'>windbreaker</b>. It's chilly.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>I don't understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood <b title='wide city street, often with trees on each side'>Boulevard</b> in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>The what?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation "Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey. Seriously? Didn't you get enough of this <b title='clique - a small group of people who think they are special and do not want other people to join them'>cliquey</b> crap in high school?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn't have any.<br>
<i>Penny</i>None?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a <b title="‘prostitute’ or ‘whore’ in Spanish">puta</b> and made me stop. Hang on. It's the wildebeest. Priya just made a <b title='criticizing sb/sth in an unkind and indirect way'>snide</b> comment about your acting career.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wh- What the hell did she say?<br>
<i>Amy</i>She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That bitch!<br>
<i>Amy</i>How do you wanna handle it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Got it. Is it gonna to be in 3-D?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm gonna say 3-D. That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.
<s>Raj's apartment. They are playing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Wiki</a>]'>Jenga</b>.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding. 3-D?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That's what I hear.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then the studio must have real faith in it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wonder why she didn't tell me.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, it's not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.<br>
<i>Priya</i>What other thing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don't, oh, what's the word I'm looking for?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not gonna help you. This is hilarious.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>She's also dating an astronaut.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Wow. That's very impressive.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah. But Leonard's impressive, too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. <b title='confused and unable to think normally'>Befuddled</b>. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
<s>The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by himself.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I need a hug.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry, I have company. (Closes the door)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, Sheldon, open the door.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't want to hug you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I don't wanna hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Blue, as in depressed.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, not so much depressed as lonely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know what color lonely is.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. Come in. You look <b title='absolutely'>positively</b> orange with loneliness. No, I don't see <b title='orange = lonely'>that</b> <b title='catch on - become popular or fashionable'>catching on</b> at all.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm working on my three-person chess game.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, cool. Can I play?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, thank you. I'm fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, it's not optional. We're out of tea. I hope you like <b title='a liquid made by boiling meat or vegetables in water, used for making clear soups or sauces ↗broth, stock'>bouillon</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering what's got me down.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king's <b title='stupid or not sensible'>feeble-minded</b> but well-meaning cousin?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm gonna be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I'm such a <b title='If you describe sb as a basket case, you think that they are insane. =nutcase'>basket case</b>, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yellow. Go ahead.<br>
<i>Raj</i>A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing. He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fascinating. What's in it?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I like cows.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's not the point.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was its own point. Go on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm a scientist. My ability to think is my <b title='sth that provides your main income ↗live on, livelihood'>bread and butter</b>. I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like <b title='a brand of small, hard mints [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_Tac">Wiki</a>]'>Tic Tacs</b>.
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I'm still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't know. The regular way people meet astronauts.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Most of those guys live in Texas.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Obviously, this one doesn't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Leonard lives here. Priya's from India. People meet, Howard. God!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never <b title='grill - ask sb a lot of questions for a long time'>grilled</b> you about that. I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm not grilling you, I was just curious.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie <b title='character/role'>part</b>. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?<br>
<i>Priya</i>I'm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He's a consultant.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>He can't have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that <b title='not seeming reasonable or likely to be true'>implausible</b>, as well? (Leaves)<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>(To the shoes) All right, guys, you have to go back. I can't afford you. "No, don't send us away, we love you." I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. "But, Penny, you look so good in us." Damn it, the shoes are right.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='used to express surprise'>Good golly</b>, Penny, your <b title='odd or playful behavior or humor'>whimsy</b> is boundless. (Phone rings) What do you got for me, wildebeest?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>(In Raj's bathroom) I think they're on to me. The story's starting to fall apart.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Calm down. Everything's gonna be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>In the bathroom.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom <b title='gabfest - an occasion when people talk to each other a lot ↗gab, festival'>gabfests</b>. What's the problem?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>They're just asking all sorts of questions I can't answer.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Just change the subject.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya's parents.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>They said something about going there this summer.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What, are they getting engaged?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't know. I was too busy covering my <b title='buttocks'>heinie</b> on Amy's stupid astronaut story!<br>
<i>Amy</i>What astronaut story?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I texted architect. That's amusing. Auto-correct must've changed it.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yeah, it's <b title='hilarious ↗sarcasm'>hysterical</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't wanna do this anymore!<br>
<i>Penny</i>Don't you quit on us!<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Knocking on bathroom door) Bernie, you okay?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>(Screaming) It was an architect!
<s>A coffee shop.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You're a good friend.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm glad you think so. That's what I strive to emulate.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, let's see if this drug works.<br>
<i>Woman at table</i>Can I help you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Thank you. That's a great accent. Where are you from?<br>
<i>Raj</i>India.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Oh, cool. I've always wanted to go there.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's a beautiful country. You'd love it. May I join you?<br>
<i>Woman</i>Uh, okay, sure. Why not?<br>
<i>Raj</i>My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, there's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.<br>
<i>Woman</i>What's he observing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We're scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone. (Gives Sheldon a bill)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And what is your name?<br>
<i>Woman</i>Angela.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.<br>
<i>Angela</i>You're cute.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(At the counter) I'd like to buy a scone.<br>
<i>Server</i>Oh, I'm sorry, we're out. We have muffins.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They sound delicious, but this money is <b title='earmark - assign or set aside sb/sth to or for a special purpose'>earmarked</b> for scones.<br>
<i>Angela</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Taking his shirt off) Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?<br>
<i>Angela</i>I-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They were out of scones.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Removing his trousers) Sheldon, I'm talking to someone. You're being rude. I'll bet you're an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.<br>
<i>Angela</i>Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. (Takes off his underwear) Ta-da! (Sheldon's observing)
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Priya</i>Who wants some more coffee?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks, yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Let me help you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nice to see that the gals are getting along.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Gals? Who are you, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Flintstone">Wiki</a>]'>Fred Flintstone</b>?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>This trip to India sounds fun.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Yeah, I think it will be.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?<br>
<i>Priya</i>A little. They're very old-fashioned.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, I wouldn't worry about it. It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, God, no. We're not there yet.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to <b title='pee'>tinkle</b>.<br>
<i>Priya</i>You've been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Yes. Are you writing a book?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Why are you getting upset?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.<br>
<i>Priya</i>What's up with you? Bernadette?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I can't do this anymore! I'm a good girl! I went to Catholic school! (Storms out)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, well, it's getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think the word you're looking for is befuddled.
<s>The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing three person chess.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>My <b title='a weapon used in the past to throw heavy stones'>catapult</b> flings my bishop to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out, at Leonard's Queen's Bishop five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When it's done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Still naked) Hey, I've got winners.
