<i>Leonard</i>No, see, the liquid-metal <b title='the liquid metal, shapeshifting T-1000 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day">Wiki</a>]'>Terminators</b> were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, then read only this: assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a <b title='a woman who is petite is short and attractively thin'>petite</b>, <b title='T-X (also referred to the Terminatrix) <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Terminatrix1001.jpg/230px-Terminatrix1001.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-X">Wiki</a>]'>hot, 17-year-old killer robot</b>?<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Too late. I win.<br>
(Penny is singing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_tonight">Wiki</a>]'>"Out Tonight"</b>, off-key)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What the hell is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it, too.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Singing) You wanna prowl, be my night owl, we'll take my head- (Leonard and Sheldon quickly run down the stairs) Hi. Hey, guys! Where are you going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What? We just had to... mail some letters and throw away some chicken. (Motions to Sheldon to throw away the chicken in his bag; Sheldon reluctantlly dumps it into the garbage can)<br>
<i>Penny</i>You'll never guess what just happened.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I-I give up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't guess. As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation. Although as I'm saying this, it occurs to me you may have been <b title='employ - use'>employing</b> a <b title='rhetoric - a style of speaking or writing that is intended to influence people'>rhetorical</b> <b title='metaphor, combination of words etc'>device</b> <b title='render - cause sb/sth to be in a particular condition'>rendering</b> my response <b title='useless or irrelevant [<a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=2757829">link</a>]'>moot</b>.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Believe it or not, <b title='Sheldon can realize his response is useless or irrelevant.'>personal growth</b>. (Gives Sheldon a nod of approval; to Penny) What happened?<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of <b title='a musical/film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent">Wiki</a>]'>Rent</b>, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a conclusion based on an observion.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, you don't. (To Penny) No, he doesn't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, the girl they picked to play <b title='...He&#039;s then visited by his downstairs neighbor, Mimi, an exotic dancer and heroin addict, who flirts with him...'>Mimi</b>, she <b title='drop out - withdraw'>dropped out</b>, and they asked me to replace her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Congratulations. What a lucky <b title='chance'>break</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It-it's not that big a deal, it's just a one-night <b title='a setting in which sb/sth may be displayed, esp to advantage'>showcase</b>, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents. So, you never know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think I know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, you don't. (To Penny) He doesn't.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's this Friday night at 8:00. You guys wanna come?<br>
<i>Both</i>No. <br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because... uh, Friday we are attending a <b title='academic meeting [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>symposium</b> on molecular <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positronium">Wiki</a>]'>positronium</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think that's a week from Tuesday, at 6.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, it's this Friday. At 8.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, too bad. Well, I gotta get to rehearsal. See you guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>See you.<br>
(Penny sings and leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You just lied to Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, I did.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And you did it so casually- no rapid breathing, no increase in <b title='sweat'>perspiration</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent <b title='sb whose behavior towards other people is considered unacceptable, strange, and possibly dangerous ↗psychopath [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociopath#Sociopathy">Wiki</a>]'>sociopath</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I imagine if you were going to kill me, you'd have done it a long time ago.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's very true. (Climbs up the staircase)<br>
(Sheldon hesitates for a while, picks up the chicken out of the garbage can, blows onto it, and then goes up the staircase)
<s>In front of Leonard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I need to speak to you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's 2 o'clock in the morning!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's important.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I highly doubt that. Go away. (Pauses) Are you still out there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Opens the door) What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're right; it can wait until morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Frustrated; follows him into the living room) What, what, what, what, what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a <b title='Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a stage of sleep characterized by the rapid and random movement of the eyes. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM_Cycle">Wiki</a>]'>rem cycle</b>. You're in no state of mind to talk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, what is it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What was I supposed to say?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You could've told her the truth.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That would have hurt her feelings.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is that a relevant factor?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then I suppose you could've agreed to go.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And what would I've said afterwards?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I would suggest something to the effect of: singing is neither an appropriate <b title='a particular type of work that you feel is right for you'>vocation</b> nor <b title='an activity that sb does for enjoyment in addition to their usual work ↗hobby, pastime'>avocation</b> for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a <b title='computed axial tomography [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_axial_tomography">Wiki</a>]'>cat scan</b> to look for a tumor pressing on the <b title='related to the process of knowing, understanding, and learning sth'>cognitive</b> processing centers of your brain.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I couldn't say that. I would have to say, "you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's the social <b title='rules about the correct way to act'>protocol</b>. It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was not aware of that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, now you are.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Alright. Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again. Good night.
<s>In front of Leonard's bedroom, still at night.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath. (Opens the door) What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the <b title='trick'>ruse</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Simple. If she were to log onto www.socalphysixsgroup.org<b title='(forward) slash backslash (\)'>/</b>activities/other, click on "upcoming events, " scroll down to "seminars, " download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bippity_Boppity_Boo">Wiki</a>]'>bippity, boppity, boo</b>-- our pants are metaphorically on fire. (Leonard slams the door in his face) Well, sir, my trousers will not be <b title='ignite - causing sth to catch fire'>igniting</b> today.
<s>Hallway in front of apartments.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny? Penny? Penny? (Penny opens the door and sighs) Good morning.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do you have any idea what time it is?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course I do. My watch is linked to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock">Wiki</a>]'>atomic clock</b> in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder, _Colorado">Wiki</a>]'>Boulder</b>, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me that, once again, your question may have been <b title='using speech or writing in special ways ↗sarcastic'>rhetorical</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I remember "symposium."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Well, he lied.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait. What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, imagine how I'm feeling.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry, this really isn't my <b title='the thing you do best'>strong suit</b>.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>You told her I lied? Why would you tell her I lied?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To help you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ohh... I'm getting a bad feeling.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hunger? Indigestion? I'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that, on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's <b title='Interventions have been used to address serious personal problems, including, but not limited to, alcoholism, compulsive gambling, drug abuse, compulsive eating and other eating disorders, self harm and being the victim of abuse. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_intervention">Wiki</a>]'>drug intervention</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Your cousin Leopold.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee. Remember that. It's important.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's important?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Details, Leonard. The success or failure of our <b title='behaving dishonestly in order to trick people ↗deceptive'>deceitful</b> <b title='systematic activity'>enterprise</b> <b title='depends on'>turns on</b> details.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Do you have a cousin Leopold?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't get it. I already told her a lie. Why, why replace it with a different lie?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is <b title='exquisite - very beautiful, delicate'>exquisitely</b> <b title='complicated and difficult to follow'>convoluted</b>. While you were sleeping, I was weaving an <b title="can't be understood (unravel - understand/explain sth that is mysterious or complicated)">un-unravelable</b> web.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Mockingly) Un-unravelable?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. If she googles "Leopold Houston, " she'll find a Facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on <b title='an online dating website [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eharmony.com">Wiki</a>]'>eharmony.com</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because it's in <b title='a city in Los Angeles County in Southern California [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Long Beach</b>, and I don't drive.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We're going to Long Beach?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, of course not. There's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention. Focus, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw, come on.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the <b title="early hours of the morning, just after 12 o'clock at night">wee hours</b>, emotionally <b title='wring out - extract (liquid) by squeezing or pressing'>wrung out</b>, from the work of convincing Leo to go back into <b title='the process of curing sb who has an alcohol or drugs problem'>rehab</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He goes back into rehab?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but, he can <b title='fall back into a previous condition or a worse state after making an improvement ↗collapse, elapse'>relapse</b> if Penny ever invites us to hear her sing again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You still told her I lied.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, for a noble purpose - to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-<b title='addle - confuse sb so they cannot think properly'>addled</b> <b title="Your second cousins are the children of your parents' (first) cousins.">first cousin</b> - which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How am I supposed to member all of this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that's the best part. You don't have to. See, I told Penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie is still <b title='effective'>in force</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Pasadena</b>, when, <b title='=in reality, actually'>in actuality</b>, we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Un-unravelable.
<s>In the doorway of Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase. You look great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your... symposium.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Well, thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, I gotta tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are. You are the <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> guy who <b title='support/help'>stands by</b> a friend when... (Glances at Sheldon) when he has a symposium to go to.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Avoiding her eyes) I don't know what to say.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's okay, Leonard. (Hugs him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, okay, all right, good, good.<br>
[Howard and Raj enter]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>, group hug. (Penny stops him by saying "uh-uh, uh-uh") Okay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, what's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, Penny is on her way to perform in a one-night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend, because we're going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by Dr. <b title='↗emir - title of various Muslim rulers'>Emil</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sattareh_Farman_Farmaian">Wiki</a>]'>Farman-Farmian</b>.<br>

<i>Howard</i>No, no, you're <b title='an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark">Wiki</a>]'>quark</b>-blocking us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know what to say.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, listen.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, it's okay. It's your <b title='a fictional spacecraft in the Star Wars [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon">Wiki</a>]'>Millennium Falcon</b>. You and <b title='a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca">Wiki</a>]'>Chewbacca</b> do whatever you wanna do. Me and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia">Wiki</a>]'>Princess Leia</b> here will find some other way to spend the evening.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, sure. I-I don't see a problem with that.<br>
<i>Penny</i>There's no symposium. Leonard lied to me. Isn't that right, Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well. I don't know what to say!<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's okay; I do. Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis. He made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr. Farman...Farmian.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to show approval'>Good for you</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ha, I am! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed. And there is nothing to be embarrassed about, okay?

Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a <b title='Super 8 Worldwide, formerly Super 8 Motels, is the world&#039;s largest budget hotel chain, with motels in the United States and Canada, as well as newer properties in China.

Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this, because he's such a good man. (Hugs him again)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, another hug? Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, you guys, good luck.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks, Penny. Oh, <b title='an idiom in theatre used to wish a performer "good luck" in an ironic way. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_a_leg">Wiki</a>]'>break a leg</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Break a leg.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, road trip to Long Beach.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. We're not going to Long Beach.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a very nice community.<br>
The Queen Mary is docked there. Once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant, where they host a surprisingly <b title='very exciting and interesting'>gripping</b> murder mystery dinner.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sounds fun.<br>

(They leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, are we really going to Long Beach? (Also leaves)
<s>Leonard's bedroom. Sheldon knocks at the door.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the <b title='an officer who has the rank just below captain on a ship that is not a military ship'>first mate</b> whether it makes sense to you or not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Enters) No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you talking about? It's fine; she bought it; it's over. (Rolls over to the other side of the bed and covers his ear with a pillow. Sheldon runs to the side)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that, I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Muffled) Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because Leo's a <b title='[<a href="http://middlechildpersonality.com/middle-child-syndrome/">Middle child syndrome</a>]'>middle child</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There is no Leo! How can you say that? (Rolls again; Sheldon runs again)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You didn't read the <b title=' biography'>bio</b>, did you? He's not just a middle child, he is the <b title='typical'>quintessential</b> middle child, from a broken home, <b title='in addition to everything else you have mentioned'>to boot</b>. (Lifts Leonard's pillow) Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling, even to the point of self-destruction, is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've got a solution.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great. What is it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Get out!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. (Re-enters) I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess. (Slams the door and leaves just before Leonard throws a cup at him. The cup bangs on the door and breaks into pieces) We'll talk in the morning.
<s>The living room. Some guy is sitting at the kitchen counter, eating a bowl of cereal.</s>
<i>Leo</i>Morning.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who are you?<br>
<i>Leo</i>I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Aw God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.<br>
<i>Leo</i><b title='on the contrary, just the opposite'>Au contraire</b>. I'm 26 years old. I'm originally from... (Reads from a sheet of paper) Denton, Texas, but I was a <b title='a child whose family moves often because one or both parents works for the navy'>navy brat</b>, so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world. As a result, I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my <b title='drug abuse [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse">Wiki</a>]'>substance abuse</b> problem.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Appears) Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.<br>
<i>Leo</i>Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go with pop psychology?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>For your information, this is all based on solid research. Just stick with the character profile I wrote for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld. He's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also <b title='↗major'>minored</b> in theater at MIT.<br>
<i>Leo</i>It was more of a double major, actually. Theater and physics. You can guess which one my <b title='basically "middle class" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie">Wiki</a>]'>bourgeois</b> parents pushed me toward.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I got it. Sheldon. Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely <b title='reasonable'>plausible</b> that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Frustrated) Oh.<br>
<i>Leo</i>Sheldon, how about this as my motivation: when I was 14 years old, I was abused in the Philippines by a <b title='clubfoot - a foot that has been twisted to one side since birth [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubfoot">Wiki</a>]'>clubfooted</b> navy <b title='a Christian priest or minister who works in an institution such as a school or a hospital, or in the army'>chaplain</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. We're going with middle child and a genetic <b title='a tendency to behave in a particular way or suffer from a particular illness'>predisposition</b> to inadequate <b title='a chemical in the body that helps carry messages from the brain and is believed to make you feel happy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin">Wiki</a>]'>serotonin</b> production.<br>
<i>Leo</i><b title='great'>Swell</b>. How do I play genetic predisposition?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='subtext - a hidden or second meaning behind sb&#039;s words or actions'>Subtextually</b>, of course. (Someone knocks on the door) just have fun with it. (Goes to get it) Morning, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi. How did the intervention go?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, based on what you told me, I am not surprised.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Triumphantly glances at Leonard, who is upset) But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo. This is Penny, our friend and neighbor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi, leo. How are you feeling?<br>
<i>Leo</i>Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a <b title='a cheap dirty hotel'>fleabag motel</b> covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Leo</i>Then don't ask me how I'm feeling. (Penny looks at Sheldon)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, that's Leo. Hey, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, it was okay, I guess. It wasn't a big <b title='the act or an instance of turning out'>turnout</b>, but they both really seemed to like it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There were only two people there?<br>
<i>Penny</i>By the end, yeah.<br>
