<i>Penny</i>Hey, you guys ready to order?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Priya?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Uh, I'll have the <b title='a meat pie with a crust of mashed potato [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_pie">Wiki</a>]'>Shepherd's Pie</b>. You want to split that with me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you have milk in the <b title='tater - potato'>taters</b>, milk in the gravy, <b title='type of hard cheese made in Italy'>Parmesan</b> crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade#Balloon_introductions">Wiki</a>]'>Macy's Day balloon</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not quite accurate. The Macy's balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces <b title='plentiful, abundant'>copious</b> amounts of <b title='Over 99% of the volume of flatus is composed of non-smelly gases. These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. flatus - gas generated in or expelled from the digestive tract, esp the stomach or intestines'>methane</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, no, on the Shepherd's Pie. Can we move on?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_%28fish%29">Wiki</a>]'>Sea bass</b>. I'll have the sea bass.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your <b title='noisy'>rooty-tooty</b> stinky <b title='ass'>booty</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Kill me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It wouldn'help. The human body is capable of being <b title='flatulence - the condition of having too much gas in the stomach'>flatulent</b> for hours after death.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Guys, sorry I'm late. I have amazing news.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard's faulty digestive system?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what's your news, Bernadette?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I'm getting my PhD.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, congratulations.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Congratulations, honey.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Unless he takes Bernadette's last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Please, this isn't about me. I'm proud of you.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, you'll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They're gonna pay me <b title='an extremely large quantity of'>a buttload of</b> money!<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bernadette, that's great. Howard, do you make a buttload?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Better than what you've got a buttload of.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's <b title='very good or pleasant'>peachy</b>. If you do it, you're still not a doctor.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, just a <b title='warning'>heads-up</b> on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.

<i>Priya</i>Shh, my brother's going to hear you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Relax, he's got headphones on. And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really, ten miles? You're orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.<br>
<i>Priya</i>I can't believe I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, gotta go.
<s>Howard's house.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, what's up?<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, Ma! It's Raj!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>He's a doctor too, right?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, yes! Everybody's a doctor but me!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Well, whose fault is that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's up?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Leonard's putting disgusting memories in my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_foam">Wiki</a>]'>memory foam</b> mattress. Can I stay here tonight?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette. It'll just be you and my mother.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I guess that's okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Of course, he and I can play doctor!<br>
<i>Raj</i>She's kidding, right?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know, she's pretty <b title='full of energy and lively determination'>feisty</b> since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i><b title='page - call the name of sb over a loudspeaker'>Paging</b> Dr. Cutie Pie!
<s>The apartment. Sheldon is talking to Amy on webcam.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.<br>
<i>Amy</i>It's indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for <b title='a beer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anheuser-Busch_brands#Michelob">Wiki</a>]'>Michelob Lite</b>. Is there something wrong with your neck?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a <b title='one of a limited number of jeweled eggs [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9_egg">Wiki</a>]'>Faberge egg</b> on a <b title='a powdered candy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixy_Stix">Wiki</a>]'>Pixie Stick</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Have you considered massage?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'd like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I <b title='enjoy ↗ravish'>relish</b> the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the <b title='the shoulder blade ↗spatula'>scapula</b> meets the <b title='the outer end of the scapula to which the collarbone is attached'>acromion</b> <b title='small projecting part of a plant or of the body of an animal'>process</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Rotating.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean the <b title='of or relating to the fascia surrounding and separating muscle tissue. fascia - a layer of fibrous (consisting of many fibres or looking like fibres) tissue.'>myofascial</b> point</b>?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Obviously. Now <b title='press on'>bear down on</b> it like the seventh grade <b title="noogie - when sb rubs their knuckles back and forth against the top of sb else's head, very hard">noogies</b> we all know too well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I've never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's someone at my door.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That doesn't interest me. Goodbye.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can I sleep here tonight?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Leonard's having <b title='relating to the scientific study of the stars / by a very large amount'>astronomically</b> inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I can't authorize that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The <b title='a well-preserved Babylonian law code [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi">Wiki</a>]'>Hammurabic Code</b> is <b title='if sb does sth wrong, they should be punished by having the same thing done to them'>an eye for an eye</b>, not a bed for a bed.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyra_Banks">Wiki</a>]'>Tyra Banks</b> says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. This is a form <b title='indemnify - protect sb/sth against possible damage or loss by paying an indemnity to cover the costs'>indemnifying</b> me from your use of Leonard's bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a <b title='serious and strict'>stern</b> facial expression.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(After signing it) Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power <b title='an interruption or failure in the supply of power, esp electricity'>outage</b>, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Turns off the lights to show the luminous paint) I never kid about safety.
<s>Leonard's bedroom. Leonard enters, and accidentally sits on Raj. Both exclaim.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I was sleeping.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>In my bed?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I would've slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of <b title='He is best remembered for having created the original Star Trek television series and thus the Star Trek science fiction franchise. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry">Wiki</a>]'>Gene Roddenberry</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, you heard?<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='a fictional character in the Star Trek science fiction franchise. "I guess they (smartly) decided to drop the whole creepy romance between Uhura and Scotty from Star Trek V." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_%28Star_Trek%29">Wiki</a>]'>Scotty</b>, I need more power.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you kidding? He made me sign a <b title='a situation in which sb gives up a legal right or claim; an official document stating this'>waiver</b>, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in <b title='an emergency procedure to assist someone who has suffered cardiac arrest'>CPR</b>. Thank God he had a <b title='model of the human figure ↗mannequin'>dummy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, my God, she's that Mona? Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon. It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon <b title='a long narrow weapon that is fired under the surface of the sea and explodes when it hits sth ↗sperm, semen'>torpedoes</b> every night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can I bring girls here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, deal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just not against their will.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Do you really think you should be eating that cake?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If you're gonna be a <b title='trophy wife - a young beautiful woman who is married to a rich successful man who is much older than her ↗gold digger, rob the cradle, sugar daddy'>trophy husband</b> for a rich wife, you might wanna watch your waistline.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiancée's success. I'm proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Until you have kids.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You're okay to stay for a while.<br>
<i>Raj</i>When did you take my blood?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I'd follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What the hell is this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='a template used in legal documents, contracts etc'>Boilerplate</b> stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a <b title='a legal document in which a person specifies what actions should be taken for their health if they are no longer able to make decisions for themselves because of illness or incapacity [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_health_care_directive">Wiki</a>]'>living will</b> and <b title='Under the common law, a power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes "incapacitated," meaning unable to grant such a power [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_attorney#Durable_power_of_attorney">Wiki</a>]'>durable power of attorney</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>This says you can make end of life decisions for me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Please sign.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Did you sign this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's a <b title='a situation in which two people, groups, or countries give each other similar kinds of help or special rights'>reciprocity</b> clause. You <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> pull the plug on him, too.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, that seems fair.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here's your I.D. Card, your key and your <b title='one of the two front parts of the top of a coat or jacket that are joined to the collar and are folded back'>lapel</b> pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate <b title='temporarily'>pro tem</b> will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bring a ball or a <b title='flying disc [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_disc">Wiki</a>] ↗freebie'>Frisbee</b>, you know, something he can chase.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Also, you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here's the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='originated in the game of tag [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28game%29">Wiki</a>]'>No backsies</b>.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, dinner!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is this?<br>
<i>Raj</i>This is the difference between eating and dining. (Candles are lit, music is on)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Remarkable. I'm just realizing how much Leonard's been <b title='skate (by) - act in an irresponsible or superficial manner'>skating by</b> all these years.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown <b title='She has written numerous bestselling books, is the publisher of the Martha Stewart Living magazine... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart">Wiki</a>]'>Martha Stewart</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(At door) Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, it's "Penny, get your own Wi-Fi." No spaces.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy <b title='a large meal for several guests on a special occasion'>spread</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My new roommate is bending over backwards to <b title="try very hard to get sb's approval">ingratiate</b> himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice <b title='a small detail that improves or completes sth'>touch</b>, by the way.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The same thing that happened to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus">Wiki</a>] ↗Homo sapiens'>Homo Erectus</b>. He was replaced by a superior species.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm the new Homo in town. <b title='↗homosexual'>That came out wrong</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's living at my place, so I'm living here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're living here <b title='provisional - temporary'>provisionally</b>. But I must say it's looking good.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That's big.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">Wiki</a>]'>Origami</b> napkin swans, that's the <b title='the title of a newspaper story that is printed in large letters'>headline</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's a good thing.
<s>Bernadette's bedroom.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, do you know what kind of research you'll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation">Wiki</a>] ↗Oh, Leonard, already?'>premature ejaculation</b> project. I mean, it's not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, Bernie, no. You didn't have to.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I wanted to. Come on, open it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>More wine?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Here's an interesting fact about alcohol.<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title='give sb sth'>Hit me</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Man is not the only species that <b title='if fruit, beer, wine etc is fermented, the sugar in it changes to alcohol'>ferments</b> fruit in order to become <b title='drunk ↗sober, hammered, wasted, tanked'>intoxicated</b>. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their <b title='↗suitcase, boot'>trunks</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Monkeys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>When does a monkey have a trunk?<br>
<i>Penny</i>When a suitcase just won't do.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing <b title="a children's game in which you try to catch a ball that is being thrown between two other people">keep-away</b> with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. <b title='as per - according to'>Per</b> our roommate agreement, kindly <b title='stop yourself from doing sth'>refrain</b> from <b title='loud and hoarse; harsh-sounding'>raucous</b> laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard <b title='accept sb/sth that is annoying, unpleasant, etc. without complaining'>put up with</b> that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, <b title='a deity worshipped across many traditions of Hinduism [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna">Wiki</a>]'>Krishna</b>, I've got to get me some of that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, it's a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard's a noisy little dude in the <b title='bed'>sack</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Every night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I <b title='screw up - do sth wrong/incorrectly'>screwed up</b>. Leonard's a great guy. Never should've broken up with him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, uh, to <b title='express the meaning of (a piece of writing, statement etc) in different words'>paraphrase</b> Shakespeare, It's better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you poor baby.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's wrong with me, Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story, I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared. {<a href="202.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/tbbt/202.html">202</a>: No, it wasn't my cat. It was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.}<br>
<i>Penny</i>I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.<br>
<i>Raj</i>To friendship.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Off) Would you <b title='alcoholic drink ↗liquor, spirits'>booze</b> hounds please stop that <b title='extremely annoying'>infernal</b> clinking? And the answer was elephant!
<s>Raj's apartment. Leonard and Priya are kissing.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Mmm. Mmm.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Leonard, sweetheart, we're kissing, not eating hot soup.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Priya</i>(Computer tone) That's my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, come on! Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, we've been through this. It's not the time.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When is the time?<br>
<i>Priya</i>I've got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to <b title='spoil or ruin sth =mess up'>screw up</b> real big, and then I'll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?<br>
<i>Priya</i>No.<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>Where is your brother?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Out with friends.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>I don't like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>I'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're moving back to India?<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>Who's that?<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>Oh, my God! There's someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When were you gonna tell me about this?<br>
<i>Priya</i>Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.<br>
<i>Priya</i>He has many friends.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>Rajesh has many friends?<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>Why are you lying to us?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's lying because she doesn't want you to know we're dating.<br>
<i>Priya</i>Leonard!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, what difference does it make? If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.<br>
<i>Priya</i>You know what? I don't want to deal with this right now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So. Hot in India?<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>Of course it is. It always is. It's India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh. That is a beautiful <b title='a large piece of heavy cloth with a picture sewn on it using coloured threads'>tapestry</b>.

<i>Sheldon</i>What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I said, what are you doing here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I live here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have paperwork that says differently. (Knock on door) <br>
<i>Leonard</i>Priya's going back to India.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you're not going to ruin it. (Opens the door to reveal Howard) What are you doing here?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She gave me a beautiful watch.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, do you understand this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Talk to him.<br>
