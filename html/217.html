<i>Howard</i>Okay, Raj, hand me the number six <b title='a type of screw head characterized by a 6-point star-shaped pattern [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx">Wiki</a>]'>Torx screwdriver</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Stop. We can't do this. It's not right.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, you have two choices. Either You let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo or you delete stuff before we go out of town.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But once you open the box, you voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred <b title='formal agreement that is legally binding'>covenant</b> we've entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to <b title='support'>stand by</b> his equipment. And we in return, agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and <b title='absence of government or control in society, lawlessness'>anarchy</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, then we won't touch the hard drive. We'll just erase the first season of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(1978_TV_series)">Wiki</a>]'>Battlestar</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Rips off the orange sticker) There. We're outlaws.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Enters with a pink bag) Here you go, Leonard. Is this gonna be big enough?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's perfect.<br>
<i>Howard</i>For taking <b title='黄水仙花 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffodils">Wiki</a>]'>daffodils</b> to your unicorn.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's just for my <b title='↗laptop'>notebooks</b>. Thanks, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I understand your envy. This is a can't-miss <b title='a meeting at which experts have discussions about a particular subject; a small conference'>symposium</b>. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a round table on the non-<b title='state of being balanced'>equilibrium</b> Green's Function approach to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoionization">Wiki</a>]'>photoionization</b> process in atoms.<br>
<i>Penny</i>When I go, I usually just get <b title='drunk ↗wasted, tanked'>hammered</b> and ride the cable cars.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This conference is kind of a big thing. The <b title='the most important part of sth'>keynote</b> address is being delivered by <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smoot">Wiki</a>]'>George Smoot</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God. The George Smoot?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You've heard of him?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Of course I haven't.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and <b title='the property of being directionally dependent [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy">Wiki</a>]'>anisotropy</b> of the cosmic microwave background radiation <b title='cement - establish firmly'>cemented</b> our understanding of the origin of the universe.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's kind of a funny name though. Smoot.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's like talking to a <b title='chimpanzee ↗gorilla, ape, gibbon'>chimp</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I wish.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We're not flying. We're taking the train.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, cool.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying and costs almost twice as much.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well then why are you doing it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train. So we're taking the train.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't say it like that, Leonard. Say it like, "We're taking the train!"
<s>Sheldon's office. Knocking on door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey, we're all going up to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the <b title='a tech support station located inside some Apple retail stores [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_Bar">Wiki</a>]'>Genius Bar</b>. You wanna come?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching <b title='Radio-frequency identification [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification">Wiki</a>]'>RFlD</b> tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-reference">Wiki</a>]'>cross-reference</b> them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, etc.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this gonna take?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours 11 minutes. Plus however long it takes to <b title='end'>conclude</b> this fairly pointless conversation.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't follow. (Teasing Sheldon is enough)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Scanner beeps) Socks, one pair, cotton, <b title='consisting of different colored diamond shapes'>argyle</b>, blue. (Scanner beeps) Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.
<s>A <b title='↗carriage, car'>coach</b>. Raj is putting his luggage on the shelf.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>What on earth are you doing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Whatever it is, I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Gentlemen, this is the <b title='a passenger train operated by Amtrak on the West Coast of the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Starlight">Wiki</a>]'>Coast Starlight</b>, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you'll see <b title='an impressive view of a wide area of land'>panoramic</b> ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation. While on your side you'll be treated to 350 miles of <b title='Costco Wholesale Corporation is a membership-only warehouse club that provides a wide selection of merchandise. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco">Wiki</a>]'>Costcos</b>, <b title='a chain of over 2, 000 businesses in North America offering oil changes and other automotive services. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiffy_Lube">Wiki</a>]'>Jiffy Lubes</b> and <b title='a large rectangular brick used in construction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_block">Wiki</a>]'>cinder block</b> homes with <b title='A pool can be built either above or in-ground [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool">Wiki</a>]'>above-ground pools</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, Raj. (Goes over to the side)<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the <b title='system of linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels'>suspension</b> characteristics of a pre-1980 <b title='The Pullman Palace Car Company, founded by George Pullman, manufactured railroad cars in the mid-to-late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century, during the boom of railroads in the United States. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman_Company">Wiki</a>]'>Pullman</b>-built <b title='↗liner, cruiser, yacht'>Superliner</b> Deluxe passenger coach?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds and you've already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Here. I'm hoping once you reap the <b title='endorphin - a chemical produced by your body that reduces pain and can make you feel happier [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphine">Wiki</a>] 内啡肽'>endorphic</b> rewards of the steady <b title='clicket-clack - a fast and rhythmic click-clack'>clickety-clack</b> of steel wheels on polished rails, your <b title='unpleasant'>sour</b> <b title='temperament'>disposition</b> will <b title='become less strong or decrease ↗alleviate, ease'>abate</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile, back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in upright position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's not so bad really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you <b title='↗kneel, crouch'>squat</b> over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of <b title=' India&#039;s largest state by area [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan">Wiki</a>]'>Rajasthan</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways' magnificent <b title='an express train belonging to Indian Railways that run between Bikaner and Mumbai in India [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranakpur_Express">Wiki</a>]'>Ranakpur Express</b> and its 1200-kilometer journey from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra">Wiki</a>]'>Maharashtra</b> to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikaner">Wiki</a>]'>Bikaner</b> Junction.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, look. Now he's boring on an international scale.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Holy crap, look.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is that who I think it is?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It can't be. What would <b title='an American actress best known for playing River Tam in the space western series Firefly and its film sequel Serenity, Cameron in the science fiction series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau">Wiki</a>]'>Summer Glau</b> be doing riding the train?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Unlikely. That's a television show, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course, if Skynet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to <b title='secretly put people into an organization or place in order to find out information or to harm it ↗penetrate'>infiltrate</b> and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in films and television series <b title='lull - make sb feel relaxed or confident so that they are not prepared for anything unpleasant'>lulling</b> us into a false sense of security, i. e.: "That's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don't kill me! I'm <b title='supporting'>pro-</b>robot." (Mimics being shot and groans)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>At least he's off the train crap.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wheeee.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a <b title='single successful or effective action or occurrence'>stroke</b> of brilliance. I've actually got a <b title='attempt, chance'>shot</b> at a Terminator.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>. When it comes to Terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a <b title='small and enclosed by walls or sides'>confined</b> space. Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train, <b title='draw sth together into a small space'>tuck</b> and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually <b title='give in'>succumb</b> to the <b title='acquire a taste for sth - begin to like sth'>acquired</b> taste that is Howard Wolowitz.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='I bet she will tuck and roll'>My money's on tuck and roll</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's Summer Glau.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='used to say that sth has ended'>That's it</b>. (Get ready to make a move on her)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hang on a sec. Why do you get first <b title='attempt'>crack</b> at her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, well, let's see. Couple reasons. One, I saw her first.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No, you didn't. I did.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='used to say that an idea or suggestion seems reasonable'>Fair enough</b>. But then let me move on to number two. Unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm <b title='↗drunk, drunken, wasted, hammered, tanked'>sober</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are <b title='weak and thin ↗fragile'>frail</b> and <b title='pale and not looking healthy ↗paste'>pasty</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, you know the old saying. Pasty and frail, never fail.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fine, go ahead, take a shot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, I've already got a <b title='very beautiful'>gorgeous</b> blonde back home that I can't <b title='have sex'>score</b> with. I think I'll let you two take this one.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the <b title='↗redecorate'>refurbished</b> Pacific <b title='a shop or type of business that provides a particular service'>Parlour</b> Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level-<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah yeah yeah, which way?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Upper level is a bar that offers wine <b title='an event that is organized so that you can try different foods or drinks to see if you like them'>tastings</b> if you're going as far as <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Wiki</a>]'>Portland</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, aren't you gonna go talk to her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I will. I'm just working on my opening <b title='words'>line</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She's probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don't you just try "Hello?"<br>
<i>Howard</i>No no no no. That always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that's funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual <b title='a natural quality or ability that sb has'>endowment</b> is disproportionate to my physical <b title='height of the body ↗posture'>stature</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're gonna need more than 11 hours.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh no.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I forgot my flash drive.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So we have to go back.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, Sheldon, I'm gonna say "Why?" and your answer cannot be "Because I forgot my flash drive."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't understand. My flash drive has my paper on <b title='Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe'>astrophysical</b> <b title='probe - an attempt to find out the truth about sth'>probes</b> of <b title='a theory in physics that unifies all of the consistent versions of superstring theory.'>M-theory</b> effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's brilliant. He needs to read it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So you'll send him an email when we get back.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Of course.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, this is an <b title='complete, utter, absoulte'>unmitigated</b> disaster.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax. Sit back and enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You forgot your flash drive / You forgot your flash drive / You forgot your flash drive / You forgot your flash drive / You forgot your flash drive<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Only 10 hours, 55 minutes to go.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You forgot your flash drive / You forgot your flash drive<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Resolutely stands up) It's hot in here. Must be Summer. (Goes over to her; skips past her; goes back; tries to talk but fails. To two Sisters at the opposite side) So, where are you gals headed?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, I found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in <b title='a city in the United States, located along the coast of Southern California'>Oxnard</b>. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive and then race to <b title='a city in the U. S. state of California, located roughly midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco on the Central Coast'>San Luis Obispo</b>, we assume the lights are with us, minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've got a better idea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you going to be sarcastic?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me. But, look, Penny's home. Why don't we just call her, have her get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The key is hidden in my room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny would have to go into my room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>People don't go in my room.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I see. Well, it seems once again you<b title='to find yourself in a position where any outcome of a difficult decision or situation results in some sort of difficulties'>'re caught between a rock and a crazy place</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I hate when that happens.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's hot in here. Must be Summer. It's hot in here. Must be summer. It's hot in here. Must be Summer.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Comes back. Loud) It's hot in here. Must be Summer.<br>
<i>Summer</i>That's cute.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? I just made it up. Have you seen <b title='a 2008 British drama film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire">Wiki</a>]'>Slumdog Millionaire</b>?<br>
<i>Summer</i>Oh yeah, I loved it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's loosely based on my life.
<s>Penny's living room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, we're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theater. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might wanna come? Oh, hang on. (Switches the line) Hello?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Listen carefully. I'm about to give you a set of instructions which you must follow <b title='paying strict attention to every detail ↗literally, exactly'>to the letter</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Just a sec. (Switches back) The theater's above a bowling alley so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play <b title='Annelies Marie "Anne" Frank 12 June 1929 – early March 1945) was a diarist and writer. She was one of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank">Wiki</a>]'>Anne Frank</b>. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I'll see you then. (Switches to Sheldon) Hello?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Your dresser? Who is this?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's Sheldon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, Sheldon. How's San Francisco?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a tra- Were you even listening to me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, no, I was talking to my friend. But what's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What's up? I'll tell you what's up. I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you to <b title='gather, arrange'>marshal</b> your powers of concentration, limited as they may be-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give me the phone. (On phone) Hi, Penny, it's Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Leonard, what's going on with Dr. <b title='a crazy person'>Wackadoodle</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, he's calling to ask you a favor. You might be confused because he didn't use the words "Penny, " "Sheldon, " "please" or "favor."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Enough <b title='casual conversation, small talk'>chitchat</b>. Okay, step one: Locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two: Enter our apartment. Step three: (Hesitates) Enter my bedroom. Step four-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, hang on Sheldon, get another call.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.
<s>The car.</s>
<i>Raj</i>And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that's Venus.<br>
<i>Summer</i>That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Come on. When you were on TV in <b title='an American space western drama television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Firefly</b>, you were actually in space.<br>
<i>Summer</i>You're not one of those guys who believe that are you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. (Howard snatches the bottle) Now him, he's one of those geeks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, now before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this one time grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It's a legal right of access. <b title='used when you are slightly surprised or annoyed'>Good grief</b>. What? No, don't put me on hold. Oh...<br>
<i>Howard</i>Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he's <b title='M. Night Shyamalan is an Indian-born American screenwriter, film director, and producer. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan">Wiki</a>] ↗'>M. Knight Charmalarmalon</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is that what he's drinking? It's not even real beer.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Some sort of <b title='harmless substance given as if it were medicine to calm a patient'>placebo</b> effect, I guess.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Placebo, you say. Interesting.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, I'm still here. Where am I going? I'm on a train. Now, what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoberman_sphere">Wiki</a>]'>Hoberman Sphere</b> and a sample of quartz <b title='fleck - a small piece of sth'>flecked</b> with <b title="fool's gold, 黄铁矿石">pyrite</b>. Hoberman Sphere. It's a collapsible <b title='An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosidodecahedron">Wiki</a>]'>icosidodecahedron</b>. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock. (To Leonard; mouths) My God.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Actually, in lndia, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the <b title='dipper - a large spoon with a long handle [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper">Wiki</a>]'>Big Dipper</b>, we have the Big Curry Pot.<br>
<i>Summer</i>You're making that up.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You got me. Now, what are you going to do with me?<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Approaches) Raj?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Look.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What am I looking at?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You tell me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Non-alcoholic beer. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Sits down opposite her) Hi. I'm the small package good things come in.<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's the wrong box. Put it back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't read those letters.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Put down the letters!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Snatches the phone) Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Delightful. Listen, I don't know what you're doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming in the corner of Sheldon's mouth.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Yeah, I kinda crossed a line. Put him back on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What up, Moon Pie?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No one calls me Moon Pie but <b title='Sheldon&#039;s nickname for his maternal grandmother [<a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Meemaw">Wiki</a>]'>Meemaw</b>. (Leonard motions Sheldon to give him the phone)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Penny. Leonard again.<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Howard</i>So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then I picked you up by your ankles and <b title='twirl - make sth turn around and around'>twirled</b> you round and round until your legs tore off. I mean, I-I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of <b title='type of (esp German) wholemeal rye bread '>pumpernickel</b> bread. What do you think that means?<br>
<i>Summer</i>I really don't know.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll give you a little clue. My favorite sandwich? <b title='a type of strong-flavored sausage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami">Wiki</a>]'>Salami</b> on pumpernickel.<br>
<i>Summer</i>Is that so?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did you know the word pumpernickel comes from the German words pumper and knickel? Which loosely translates to fart <b title='a small ugly creature in fairy tales'>goblin</b>?<br>
<i>Summer</i>No. I didn't.<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I found the box. Now what?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're holding a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_puzzle_box">Wiki</a>]'>Japanese puzzle box</b>, which takes 10 precise moves to open. Okay, you first, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the center portion 1 millimeter to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down 2 millimeters. You'll hear a slight click.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. It's a <b title='small toy, ornament, etc of low value'>novelty</b> I ordered off the Internet. Did you hear the click?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not yet. (Puts it on the floor and stamps on it) There it is.<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, here's another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Winter">Wiki</a>]'>Johnny Winter</b>, you'd be Summer Winter.<br>
<i>Summer</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep. Okay, I'm gonna just <b title='risk everything in one determined attempt at sth '>go for broke</b> here and say I like you.<br>
<i>Summer</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, here's my question: Do you realisticlly see any conversational path that would take us from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you'd say yes?<br>
<i>Summer</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.<br>
<i>Summer</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?<br>
<i>Summer</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Holds her) Okay. Great. Now can I take one where it looks like we're making out?<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, now, you're going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I'm <b title='attractive'>nummy</b>-nummy and she could just eat me up. Now please, put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck's mouth. (Howard comes back)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, how'd it go?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Terminator broke my phone.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me. (Goes over and sits in the seat opposite her) Okay, I'll be honest with you. I just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you, but then I finally realized you're a human being, I'm a human being. I could just say- (Conductor on <b title='public address system'>PA</b>) Next stop, Santa Barbara.<br>
<i>Summer</i>I'm sorry. This is me. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hi, my name's Leonard.

<i>Sheldon</i>So I'm thinking, you won the Nobel Prize, what, three years ago, so you must deal with a whole lot of "What has Smoot done lately?" My thought is, we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and, when we win the Nobel Prize, you'll be back on top.<br>
<i>Smoot</i><b title='used when you are going to disagree, usu quite strongly, with sb'>With all due respect</b>, Dr. Cooper, are you on <b title='cocaine'>crack</b>? (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a <b title='sb who behaves as a goddess or queen'>diva</b>.
