<s>The living room. Howard is unpacking Chinese food using a robotic hand.</s>
<i>Howard</i>And now the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Pao_chicken">Wiki</a>]'>Kung Pao chicken</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='awesome, cool'>Smooth</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>And finally, my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo_shu_pork">Wiki</a>]'>Moo shu pork</b>.<br>
[Everyone applauds]<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And it only took 28 minutes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Impressive, but we must be cautious.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it <b title='The Terminator is a 1984 science fiction film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29">Wiki</a>]'>travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't think that's gonna happen, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No one ever does. That's why it happens.<br>
[Penny enters]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What's that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for <b title='performed by an astronaut outside a spacecraft in space'>extravehicular</b> repairs on the International Space Station.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ah, cool.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Ask me to pass the <b title='a dark brown liquid made from soya beans and used as a flavouring, especially in Chinese cooking'>soy sauce</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, does that come up much on the space station?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right. Pass the soy sauce.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Coming up. (Starts to hit the keyboard)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How's work?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's not bad. <b title='kind of'>Kinda</b> hungry.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, we all are.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Still hitting the keyboard) Just wait.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? They're gonna make a robot that spits on your hamburger?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Leonard) I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, <b title='used when you are going to try to do sth difficult or dangerous'>here we go</b>. Passing the soy sauce. (To Penny) <b title='move your hand forward and away from your body'>Put out your hand</b>.<br>
(The hand drops a soy sauce pack onto Penny's hand)<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's amazing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wouldn't say amazing.<br>
At best, it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us <b title='an attraction at the Magic Kingdom in the Walt Disney World Resort and at Tokyo Disneyland in the Tokyo Disney Resort, as well as a former attraction at Disneyland Park [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Bear_Jamboree">Wiki</a>]'>Country Bear Jamboree</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
(Howards gestures with the robotic hand) <br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Peace?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, <b title='the middle finger [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger">Wiki</a>]'>not peace</b>. Hang on.
<s>The living room, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at <b title='Jet Propulsion Laboratory [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory">Wiki</a>]'>JPL</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You stole it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me. (Checks his phone) Amy's at the dry cleaners, and she's made a very amusing <b title='an amusing use of a word or phrase that has two meanings'>pun</b>. "I don't care for <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachloroethylene">Wiki</a>]'>perchloroethylene</b>, and I don't like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol">Wiki</a>]'>glycol</b> <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether'>ether</b>." Get it? She doesn't like glycol ether. Sounds like "either." "<b title='laugh out loud [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOL">Wiki</a>]'>L-O-L</b>."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Who's Amy?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>His girlfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon has a girlfriend?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's not my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How long has this been going on?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Four months.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's not my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you, "What's new?" and you never thought to go with, "Sheldon has a girlfriend"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's not my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ah... d-d-d-d... How did they meet?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Raj and I entered Sheldon's information on a dating site, and it <b title='say'>spit</b> out Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Or, as we call them, "Shamy."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Shamy. I am so <b title='like, support, enjoy'>digging</b> the Shamy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, what do you communicate about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, my work in physics, her work in <b title='The term is usually used interchangeably with the term neuroscience (the scientific study of the nervous system) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiology">Wiki</a>]'>neurobiology</b>, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.<br>
[Drink comes out of Penny's mouth. She coughs. The robotic arm hands her a tissue.]<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait a minute, a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you're considering having a baby?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a <b title='series of people following one another in time, esp generations of the same family'>line</b> of intellectually superior, <b title='kindly, gentle'>benign</b> overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I have a question.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You don't even like people touching you. How are you gonna have sex?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why on Earth would we have sex?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a <b title='god/goddess'>deity</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='"Oh, God" is an unnecessary appeal to a deity'>Yes, exactly</b>. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished <b title='relating to a hospital or clinic'>clinically</b>, with fertility experts in a lab with <b title='a shallow covered dish used for growing bacteria, etc. in'>petri dishes</b>. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain <b title='healthy and strong'>corn-fed</b> <b title='physical/mental energy/determination'>vigor</b>. Is your womb available for rental?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Still digging the Shamy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about- uh, gee, I don't know- maybe actually spending some time with her?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean dating?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't date Amy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She's not my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh... getting to know the future mother of your child.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. I hadn't considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our <b title='offspring'>progeny</b>. And you don't think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Probably not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
<s>The hallway between apartments.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Knocks at the door) Penny. Penny. Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we're having right now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's great. Have fun. (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. You have to drive me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know I don't drive.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, go ask Leonard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I did. He said, and I quote, "Ask Penny. It was her <b title='ridiculous, pointless, or nonsensical'>cockamamy</b> idea."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard said "cockamamy"?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Actually, I'm <b title='express in a shorter, clearer, or different way what sb has said or written'>paraphrasing</b>. Having been raised in a Christian household, I'm uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable with "cockamamy."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, fine. When's the date?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hurry. We're going to be late.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. Do you have other plans?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, no, not <b title='by/of itself'>per se</b>, but...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking <b title='a speech in a play in which an actor or actress speaks to himself or herself and to the audience'>soliloquy</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Let me get my... cockamamy keys.
<s>Howard's bedroom. He is enjoying a massage from his robotic hand.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that's the spot. Oh, baby.<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, dinner's ready!<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll eat later. I'm busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. (Gets an idea) Hmm.
<s>Penny's car.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you for driving me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're welcome.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I wish you weren't wearing <b title='open shoes which are held on your feet by a strap that goes between your toes. =thongs'>flip-flops</b>. It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Sorry. I just don't want to be <b title='used for emphasis'>yet</b> another flip-flop <b title='a death in an accident'>fatality</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Well, my question is, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That depends. Does <b title='a dance for four couples [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_dance">Wiki</a>]'>square-dancing</b> with my sister at a <b title='a non-profit organization [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teens_for_Christ">Wiki</a>]'>Teens for Jesus</b> <b title='Independence Day [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_of_July">Wiki</a>]'>Fourth of July</b> <b title='a party at which people dance square dances'>Hoedown</b> count as a date?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then, this is my first date.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have a master's degree and two <b title='the highest degree awarded by a university'>doctorates</b>. The things I should know, I do know.<br>
<i>Penny</i>My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you know so much, <b title='why'>how come</b> I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fair point.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Raj</i>You know, there's something I've always wondered about <b title='a fictional character, a superhero appearing in comic book titles by DC Comics. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman">Wiki</a>]'>Aquaman</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Where does he poop?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What would a toilet look like in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_%28DC_Comics%29">Wiki</a>]'>Atlantis</b>? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?<br>
[Phone rings]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hold that thought. Hey, Howard. What's going on? What... Hold on. Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? (To Raj) You're not gonna believe this.
<s>Penny's car. Sheldon's in the front seat, while Amy's in the back seat.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you're a neuro...something-or-other.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Neurobiologist. Your "check engine" light is on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, it's okay.<br>
<i>Amy</i>But the light indicates...<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't bother.<br>
I've wasted <b title='a large number of'>many an</b> hour <b title='attacking imaginary enemies [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_at_windmills">Wiki</a>]'>tilting at that particular windmill</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells great.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title="small white pieces of dead skin in sb's hair">Dandruff</b> shampoo. I have dry <b title='skin of the head excluding the face'>scalp</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Aw. Well, your hair looks very nice.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you a <b title='sb who is attracted sexually to people of the same sex'>homosexual</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no, I'm just giving you a compliment.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hmm. Would've been more flattered if you were a homosexual.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Guys, how about some music?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that. Amy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, why don't you tell her?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right. (To Amy) It was hell.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Any <b title='sth that is done to continue or add to sth done previously'>follow up</b>, Amy?<br>
<i>Amy</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I <b title='used for emphasis'>myself</b> grew up in <b title='a state on the Great Plains of the Midwestern United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Nebraska_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Nebraska_in_United_States.svg/270px-Nebraska_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Nebraska</b>. Small town outside of <b title=' the largest city in the state of Nebraska [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha">Wiki</a>]'>Omaha</b>. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few <b title='methamphetamine hydrochloride. an extremely addictive drug'>meth</b> labs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. I was just trying something.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='In the Harry Potter book series, a muggle is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born into the magical world.'>Muggles</b>.
<s>Howard's bedroom.</s>
<i>Raj</i>You slipped and fell into a robot hand?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Penis first?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes. Now, help me!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'd suggest a <b title='a substance put on any surface to help it move more easily against another one'>lubricant</b>, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not funny, Leonard.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your <b title='male genitals/genitalia'>junk</b>, dude. That's funny, ask anyone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Plea- before my mother walks in, get this off me!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, let's see.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no! Don't touch. The program is paused.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, then let's un-pause it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Al-all right. How-how about this. When-when <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh">Wiki</a>]'>Winnie the Pooh</b> got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You do what you want, I'm not touching another man's honey tree.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?<br>
<i>Howard</i>What?! No saws! One <b title="circumcise - cut the protecting loose skin off a boy's penis">circumcision</b> was enough. How about an <b title='used to cut a steel pipes etc [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene_torch">Wiki</a>]'>acetylene torch</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, then what do you want us to do?<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's great, Mom, thanks!<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>I'll bring them up with some Hawaiian <b title='a wide assortment of drinks, both non-alcoholic and alcoholic, generally containing fruit or fruit juice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_%28drink%29">Wiki</a>]'>Punch</b>!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't come up here!<br>
<i>Mrs. Wolowitz</i>Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, but that's not the point! (To Raj and Leonard) Get me out of here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh-oh, you have any ideas, Raj?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
<s>A restaurant. Penny is having dinner with Sheldon and Amy.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Big night? The <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice">Wiki</a>]'>winter solstice</b> is a big night. It's over 14 hours in Southern California.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That's an amusing <b title='a brief, somewhat interesting fact'>factoid</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date. Discuss.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Is this true?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Apparently, a semi-<b title='an incestuous relationship is one involving sexual intercourse between two members of the same family'>incestuous</b> Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Once a year. It's a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her <b title='an indoor, electrically-heated grill [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Foreman_Grill">Wiki</a>]'>George Foreman Grill</b> that seals in the flavor without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few.<br>
(Sheldon chuckles)<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's (Imitates him)...?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as "a few."<br>
<i>Penny</i>What... Where did you get 171 men?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Simple <b title='extrapolate - guess or think about what might happen from information that is already known'>extrapolation</b>. In the three years that I've known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different <b title='suitor - a man who wants to marry a particular woman'>suitors</b>. If we work backwards, correcting for observation <b title='a statistical sampling or testing error caused by systematically favoring some outcomes over others.'>bias</b> and <b title='claim or imagine that sth is true or that it exists'>postulate</b> an initial dating age of 15...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. Sixteen?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fourteen.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_curve">Wiki</a>]'>bell curve</b> peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to<br>
193 men. Plus or minus eight men.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate. Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So we multiply 193 minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so, 172 times 0.18 gives us... 30.96 sexual partners. Let's round that up to 31.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I'm gonna need a drink over here.<br>
<i>Amy</i>This is very interesting. Cultural <b title='way of seeing or understanding sth'>perceptions</b> are <b title='≠objective'>subjective</b>. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No! No! No. Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is an interesting topic. (To Amy) How many sexual encounters have you had?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I should think so.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Then 128.
<s>An emergency room. Leonard, carrying a laptop, Raj, the robotic arm, and Howard, enter.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, come on. Almost there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Don't <b title='pull with one or more short, quick pulls'>tug</b>. No tugging.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Next time, take your own advice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(To Althea, the receptionist) Excuse me, could you help us out?<br>
<i>Woman</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>My</b>, my, my. What do we have here?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I slipped and fell.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's a robot arm.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Where's the rest of the robot?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I only built the arm.<br>
<i>Woman</i><b title='because'>'Cause</b> that's all you needed, right?<br>
(Leonard and Raj laugh)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Can you please just help me?!<br>
<i>Woman</i>All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. (On public address system) I need an <b title='sb who does unskilled jobs in a hospital'>orderly</b> with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You think you could be a little more <b title='polite and careful in what you do or say'>discreet</b>?<br>
<i>Woman</i>I'm sorry, we don't have a code for "robot hand grasping a man's penis." Why is it hooked up to a computer?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, it's what controls the arm.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But it's frozen.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Did you try turning it off and back on again?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, you see, it's more complicated than that. (Althea reaches for the laptop) No, wait! Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
<s>The staircase.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I did not have sex with 31 guys.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='whatever happens'>In any event</b>, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.<br>
<i>Penny</i>And that is?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Using <b title='a process by which an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilization">Wiki</a>]'>in vitro fertilization</b> and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're still on that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you know what? I'm gonna <b title='consider or deal with a problem in a particular way'>come at</b> this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I'm gonna tell your mother on you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's no threat. My mother's always wanted a grandchild.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Your deeply religious <b title='sb who has had a strong religious experience, and is therefore very enthusiastic about their Christian beliefs and wants to share them with other people'>born-again Christian</b> mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of <b title='state of being married'>wedlock</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='impolite or obscene words used to express violent anger'>Curses</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>If I'd thought of that in the first place, I could've saved myself this whole night.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, it's not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32.<br>
(Penny glares at him)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good night.
