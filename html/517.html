<s>A corridor at the university.</s>
<i>Raj</i>It was a nice retirement party.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I guess. Still, it's a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What choice did the university have? He <b title='snap - go insane'>snapped</b>. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I wonder how long Sheldon's got.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>These shrimp are all the same size. There's no the logical order to eat them in.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can't be very long.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office. Sad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mm, indeed.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So sad.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='a right to have sth'>Dibs</b>. (They enter the office to find Kripke)<br>
<i>Kripke</i>What's up, fewwas?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you doing here, Kripke?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Ah, measuwing my new office for <b title='drapes'>dwapes</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the <b title='a program run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve which distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_for_Tots">Wiki</a>]'>Toys for Tots</b> <b title='collection'>cowwection</b> box.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You just called dibs.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>I awwived at the office first. I'm the <b title='the proverbial sth - used when you describe sth using part of a well-known expression'>pwoverbial</b> <b title='early'>earwy</b> bird.<br>
<i>Rothman</i>(Entering, naked) Gentlemen.<br>
<i>All</i>Professor Rothman.<br>
<i>Rothman</i>Good evening.<br>
<i>All</i>Good evening.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm glad that men are wearing hats again. They're so distinguished.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>I got you a little something.<br>
<i>Penny</i>A little something? Oh, it- what, this is huge.<br>
<i>Amy</i>What's huge is what you've done for me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, no, before I met you, I was a <b title='quiet and unattractive'>mousy</b> <b title='sb at a party, dance etc who is not asked to dance or take part in the activities'>wallflower</b>. But look at me now. I'm like some kinda downtown <b title='sb who is considered fashionable'>hipster</b> party girl. With a <b title='a group of friends who regularly hang out together ↗gang'>posse</b>, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, <b title='used to show that you are surprised or shocked'>of all things</b>. Open it. Open it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of Penny and Amy)<br>
<i>Amy</i>I wanted to get you something you didn't have.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow. I-I don't know what to s- Wow.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Do you like it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Do I like it? Wow.<br>
<i>Amy</i>So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I'd have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and-<br>
<i>Amy</i>No problem.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.
<s>A bathroom at the university.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I found him. He's in the bathroom. President Siebert?<br>
<i>Siebert</i>Can't this wait?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry. We just need a word.<br>
<i>Siebert</i>Now? You realize I'm your boss, and I am holding my penis?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I'm sowwy. This guy's got no wespect for boundawies.<br>
<i>Siebert</i>What do you want?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Will you tell this <b title='lunatic - insane person'>wunatic</b> that Pwofessor Wothman's office is <b title='rightful - according to what is correct or what should be done legally or morally'>wightfully</b> mine?<br>
<i>Siebert</i>Can't you take this up with your department chairman?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.<br>
<i>Siebert</i>Gentlemen, there's a task I'm trying to accomplish here, and I'm having trouble doing it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, my. President Siebert, I don't mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of <b title='a benign increase in size of the prostate [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia">Wiki</a>]'>benign prostatic hyperplasia</b>. If you're interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that'll show you how to perform your own <b title='rectum - lower end of the large intestine, through which solid waste passes to the anus'>rectal</b> exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I'm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, he's just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.<br>
<i>Siebert</i>Gentlemen, I'm going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you're both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman's office, I couldn't <b title="not give a rat's ass - not care at all. behind - buttocks">give the furry crack of a rat's behind</b>.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Well, as <b title='long'>wong</b> as we're here, I might as well take a <b title='leak'>weak</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Kripke?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're in my spot.
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>That is big.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So big.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>And ugly.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So ugly. What am I gonna do?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't know. You can't take it down. You'll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, <b title='making you feel nervous or worried'>unsettling</b>, crazy face.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is there any chance I'll learn to love it?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, it's gotta go.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What will you tell Amy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you're not in it?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom getting our hair cornrowed in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Los_Angeles">Wiki</a>]'>Venice</b> Beach. I've suffered enough.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Mmm, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's numbered.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Ooh, limited edition. Nice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Knock on door) Oh, that'll be Kripke.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's he doing here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Kripke. Come in. I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Am I weawing a summer <b title='frock - dress worn by women or girls'>fwock</b>? No, I don't want tea. Wet's get down to <b title='brass tacks - the basic facts or practical details of sth'>bwass tacks</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship-<br>
<i>Kripke</i>We're not fwiends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman's office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>How about I take Wothman's office, and you go <b title='suck a lemon - go away and do sth unpleasant to yourself'>suck a wemon</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You sure I can't get you that cup of tea?<br>
<i>Raj</i>How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?<br>
<i>Kripke</i>What the <b title='frig - have sexual intercourse; masturbate; waste time'>fwig</b> is that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. <b title='used to express acclamation, a welcome, or a greeting'>All hail</b> Sam Kass.<br>
<i>All</i>Hail.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>How does it work?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, it's very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors <b title="decapitate - cut off sb's head ↗behead">decapitates</b> lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>I'm sowwy. Can you wepeat that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Almost got it. One more time.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, stop. He's <b title='screw - jokingly deceive'>screwing</b> with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an <b title='deadlock'>impasse</b>. I see no other option than to challenge you to a <b title='a fight with weapons between two people, used in the past to settle a quarrel'>duel</b>. I'd smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's the 21st century. You can't have a duel.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a <b title='person with regard to his skill in shooting a gun, etc'>shot</b> are you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not pistols. Minds. A <b title='unimportant matters, details or information'>trivia</b> contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an <b title='of, relating to, or marked by extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images'>eidetic</b> memowy. <b title='plus'>Pwus</b>, I haven't watched Star Twek since I discovered the <b title='strip club'>stwip cwub</b> near my apartment has a fwee buffet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's gonna be hard to find something you're both equally good at.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is there anything you're both equally bad at?<br>
<i>Both</i>Sports.
<s>A basketball court.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Five what?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Dodging out of the way) Ew!<br>
[Later. Sheldon <b title='dribble - move the ball forward with repeated slight touches'>dribbling</b> ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.]<br>
<i>Kripke</i>It's out, wight?<br>
[Later. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it all the way into the back wall.]<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Time. <b title='run out of room'>Wan out of woom</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='I know why'>I get it</b>.<br>
[Later. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke.]<br>
[Later. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hey! He did that on purpose,<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, he didn't. Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let's try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No, I'm not.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball. It goes about two feet in front of him.) I'm gonna need more force.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn't come down.) Do I get points for that?<br>
[Later. A <b title='a piece of equipment on which you jump up and down as a sport'>trampoline</b> has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next, with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again.]<br>
[Later.]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do you propose?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.<br>
<i>Kripke</i>Oh, you are <b title='go down - lose'>going down</b>, Cooper.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't think so, Kripke. I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, that's enough <b title='negative or insulting things that you say to or about sb, esp an opponent'>trash talk</b>. One, two, three.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon was higher.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Who's unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
<s>Penny's apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, what a great movie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I cannot believe you've never seen <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_(film)">Wiki</a>]'>Grease</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>My mother didn't allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I gotta go. I gotta get up early. My company's testing a new <b title='a medicine used by doctors for treating conditions such as swelling, or, illegally, by athletes to improve their performance [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid">Wiki</a>]'>steroid</b> that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night, real Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You don't have to say good night to painting Amy, 'cause she's never leaving.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Good night, real Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Good night, <b title='a person, esp a man, who enjoys dressing as a member of the opposite sex'>transvestite</b> Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Entering) You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing <b title='hooligan - a noisy violent person who causes trouble by fighting etc'>hooligans</b> really got my motor running.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It's just gonna be my gift to you. Bye.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Thank you. Wait. Where'd the painting go?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's right over there.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Why?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I have no idea. That is weird.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You hate it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No. No, no. It's just, it's a little big.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I feel like an idiot.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, come on, you're not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don't need your pity.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Amy, come on.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.
<s>Rothman's office.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah, the <b title='the benefits that sb gets when they win sth, for example a war ↗loot'>spoils</b>. I see why victors love them.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door. Rothman is standing naked behind it.)<br>
<i>Rothman</i>Oh. Hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Professor Rothman. This isn't your office any more. You're retired.<br>
<i>Rothman</i>I think the word you're looking for is invisible.
<s>Amy's apartment.</s>
<i>Penny</i>I came to say I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Don't bother.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Amy, please.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I was a fool from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Nights_%28Grease_song%29">Wiki</a>]'>Summer Lovin'</b> to the <b title='used for emphasis'>very</b> last <b title='[<a href="http://grease.wikia.com/wiki/We_Go_Together">Wiki</a>]'>rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area. There's a number.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Amy, come on-<br>
<i>Amy</i>If you don't like feet, you can try dollars. The painting <b title='set back - cost sb a lot of money'>set me back</b> <b title='$3000'>three grand</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Three gr- Oh, my God! Look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don't wanna lose you out of my life.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Grab your hammer.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No. Damage is done.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, look, I didn't wanna say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, th-th-th-that's what it is, so-<br>
<i>Amy</i>You have such a good heart.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Huh, I try.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Come on.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well where are we going?<br>
<i>Amy</i>We're gonna go put this painting back up in your apartment.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what about Bernadette?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, <b title='fuck'>screw</b> her. She's just lucky we let her hang out with us.
<s>Rothman's office. Sheldon is trying to <b title='stick/fasten/attach'>affix</b> paper over a fiercely blowing air vent.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn't in my new office. No. It's next door, in Professor Davenport's office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with <b title='the cessation of a woman&#039;s reproductive ability, the opposite of menarche [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause">Wiki</a>]'>menopause</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why is there a hole here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why is there a hole in my new office? I've narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That's nice.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is it? Listen.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What, you don't like wind chimes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The bird?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't get it, do you? That's a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he's out of tune on purpose. He's mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>The growing realization that you are one <b title='crazy ↗eccentric'>wacky</b> bastard? Yep.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they're running their <b title='used when describing sth to show that you are annoyed'>confounded</b> sieve shakers again. Hey, <b title='small stones ↗pebble'>gravel</b> monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try <b title='jiggle - move sth quickly up and down or from side to side ↗juggle'>jiggling</b> your heads around!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, relax.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging <b title='nutbag ↗ball'>scrotum</b> of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?
<i>Sheldon</i>What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We're trying to think down here, you <b title='geological rock formation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode">Wiki</a>]'>geode-loving</b> <b title='a type of white or red rock ↗granite, marble, alabaster'>feldspar</b> <b title='sb who operates a specified vehicle, machine, or device'>jockeys</b>!

<i>Penny</i>How's that?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Little higher on the right.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Now?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Little more. No. That's got it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'll let you in on a little secret.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mm.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, good <b title='decision'>call</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're talking about the painting, right?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sure.
<s>Rothman's office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole in the wall.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Help! Somebody help!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would you do that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang in there. I'll be right back. (Takes out phone and takes a photo. Sits down and starts posting it online.)
