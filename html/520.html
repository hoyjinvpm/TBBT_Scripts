<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, you're right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.<br>

<i>Howard</i>Hey, Raj, you didn't send your <b title="please reply (from French 'repondez s'il vous plait')">RSVP</b> in. I'm supposed to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'll let you know.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, can you make it soon. There's a <b title='traditionally refers to a fight involving three or more combatants that is fought until only one fighter remains standing.

<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from <b title='the title character and protagonist of J. R. R.

<i>Leonard</i>Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster's wedding.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They had a make your own <b title='a sweet ice cream dessert [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundae">Wiki</a>]'>sundae</b> bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Alright, uh, fine, I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who you bringing?<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, uh, I don't think so.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.

<i>Raj</i>Listen, uh, there's something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn't ready until now, but I think it's time.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>It's finally happening. You're coming out of the closet, aren't you?<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.<br>

<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>What's that?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It means I like women as well as their skincare products.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>Well, if you're not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?<br>
<i>Raj</i>'Cause I, I'm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I'd like you to help me find uh, a wife.<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>And just to clarify, a female wife?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.<br>
<i>Mrs Koothrappali</i>We married for love.<br>
<i>Dr Koothrappali</i>And it's been wonderful.

<i>Sheldon</i>It's like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hi, you guys got a minute?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, what's up?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke the other night about me eating all your food.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group's resident <b title='sb who makes other people laugh by doing amusing things, esp in a situation when they should not do this'>cut-up</b>.<br>

So, Sheldon, <b title='Exclamation used on revealing a surprise or on completion of a hard task'>ta da</b>!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Ah! A <b title='↗vintage car'>vintage</b>, <b title='new; unsoiled; perfect ↗brand-new'>mint</b> in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where did you get that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You went to the comic-book store by yourself?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not this time. Then they wouldn't be special. Thanks Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You're welcome. Don't worry, I didn't forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wow. No, it's great. Also, uh, mint in box.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Awesome!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock <b title='a toy model of a person or imaginary being'>action figure</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's great. Let's open it up and put him in there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh dear Lord. No!<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>They're mint in box.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They're Collectables.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Once you open the box it loses its value.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh yes. In my culture it's expected to have a <b title='sb who accompanies or supervises young people on social occasions [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(social)">Wiki</a>]'>chaparone</b> to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like <b title='6 feet 2 inches'>six two</b>.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a <b title='Cattle are considered sacred in world religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and others. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_in_religion">Wiki</a>] ↗holy, sacred, saint'>cow</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Listen, I love your charming racist humor, but any chance you could not <b title='say critical or insulting things about'>knock</b> my religion while she's here.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yesterday you made fun of me for eating <b title='smoked salmon'>lox</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's different. Your people don't worship lox.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well clearly you've never been to brunch with my cousins.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I'm sure whoever shows up will be better company than a <b title='3P'>threesome</b> I've been having with <b title='a brand of pancake mix, syrup, and other breakfast foods [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima">Wiki</a>]'>Aunt Jemima</b> and <b title='[<a href="a US brand of syrups and pancake mixes">Wiki</a>]'>Mrs Butterworth's</b>.<br>

<i>Voice of Spock</i>Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is someone there?<br>
<i>Spock</i>Down here, on your desk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Spock?<br>
<i>Spock</i>I need to speak with you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.<br>
<i>Spock</i>It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be <b title='hallucinate - see or hear things that are not really there'>hallucinating</b> after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was I hit on the head by a coconut?<br>
<i>Spock</i>I'm not going to <b title='give dignity to'>dignify</b> that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But it's mint in box.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Yes, and to open it would destroy it's value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>To be played with.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Therefore? To not play with it would be?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Illogical. Damn it. Spock, you're right. I'll do it.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course. Set <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_in_Star_Trek#Phaser">Wiki</a>]'>phasers</b> to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) <b title='a word used by children to express pleasure or excitement'>Goody</b>, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I'm so excited, but this is wrong. I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it. I did it. Oh, that's what I always thought 1975 smelled like.

(Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don't be broken. Please don't be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard's toy) It's only logical.
<s>Raj's apartment.</s>
<i>Lakshmi</i>My goodness, that was delicious.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Impressive. What goes into making something like that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate <b title='a lightly baked cake [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souffl%C3%A9">Wiki</a>]'>souffle</b>, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and <b title='here it is. used when you are showing or telling sb sth surprising'>voilà</b>! Lava cake.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, let's see. Yup, three missed calls.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'd like to tell them things are going well.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we're on the same page.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, what page are you on?<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>I'm on the one where I'm on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I'm going to do it so they don't find out I'm gay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Say again.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>I'm gay.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Like, dude on dude, but with women?<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>I know a fake marriage isn't an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why me of all people?<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Well, there is a rumor back in New Delhi that you're, how shall we say, comfortable in a <b title='a South Asian female garment [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari">Wiki</a>]'>sari</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm not gay.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I'm sorry, but you're wearing more perfume than I am.<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's <b title='a perfume [<a href="http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Khloe-and-Lamar/Unbreakable-11455.html">Wiki</a>]'>Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar</b>. And for your information, it's unisex.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I like to <b title='dance, esp to fast popular music'>boogie</b>.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>Got you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.<br>
<i>Lakshmi</i>That's disappointing. You were exactly the kind of <b title='fake'>phoney</b>-baloney</b> husband I was looking for.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don't want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade <b title='a sweet whipped cream used in pastry [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantilly_cream">Wiki</a>]'>chantilly cream</b>. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.

<i>Sheldon</i>Oh dear. Two suns and no <b title='a cream or oil that you rub into your skin to stop the sun from burning you, sunblock'>sunscreen</b>.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Hello again, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What is it now, tiny Spock?<br>
<i>Spock</i>I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard's. You should be ashamed of yourself.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're the one who told me to play with it.<br>
<i>Spock</i>If I told you to jump off the bridge of the <b title='Starship Enterprise, any of several ships by that name in the Star Trek fictional universe'>Enterprise</b>, would you do it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must <b title='correct'>right</b> your wrong, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why? I <b title='get away with sth - steal sth and escape with it'>got away with it</b>. Leonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it, so he won't know it's broken. And I have a toy that isn't broken. Everybody's happy.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Well I am unhappy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.<br>
<i>Spock</i>I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know what you are? Well, you're a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_%28Star_Trek%29">Wiki</a>]'>green blooded</b> <b title='sth that spoils or ruins an otherwise enjoyable event, esp when in relation to ruining a drunken or drug-induced high'>buzzkill</b>. Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here.<br>
<i>Spock</i>Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energize. (Throws Spock away. Gets attacked by a <b title='a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorn">Wiki</a>]'>Gorn</b>. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.

<i>Raj</i>Ready for lunch?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she'd found out I'd broke my <b title="a device that keeps sb's teeth straight after they have had orthodontic treatment with a brace">retainer</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, uh, can I <b title='run by - tell sb sth so that they can give you their opinion'>run something by</b> you? It's about Lakshmi.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. Sure. How are things going?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she's a lesbian.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you mean, she's a lesbian?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they'd <b title='blow off - ignore sb in a rude manner'>blow us off</b>, and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay. It's like that. Except this time it's true.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then why did she even go out with you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I'm actually thinking about doing it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is 'cause it's crazy.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Look, Howard, you're in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette's or my mom's.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again and <b title='let yourself go - stop being careful about how you look and dress etc ↗indulge, degenerate'>let myself go</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why don't you tell your parents you wanna try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn't slept with more women than you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So you're seriously thinking about marrying someone you're never gonna have sex with.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't believe your attitude. I thought you were in favor of gay people getting married.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yes, to other gay people.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do you hear how <b title='hatred and fear of homosexuals ↗homosexual, -phobic - having a strong unreasonable fear or hatred of sth, phobia'>homophobic</b> you sound?

<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I don't want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nothing. I said nothing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That was weird.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? I don't even notice any more.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I cannot believe you guys aren't gonna play with these.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well I told you, you don't, it's mint in box.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. I just think it's a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I'm just looking at the box.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is your problem?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, I bought you this 'cause I wanted you to have fun with it. I don't want it to just sit in this box.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, you're right. I mean, it's from you, I'm never gonna sell it. I'm opening it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mmmmm!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's broken.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, nice job, man-hands.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I didn't break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let's all be mad at Stuart.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, I paid a lot for this. Let's take it over there and show him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Absolutely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn't tell you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would you open mine?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I didn't. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, you should talk to Stuart.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't, because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that's a lie.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What is the truth?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I <b title='defy - disobey or refuse to respect'>defied</b> him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, that I believe.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Mmm.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That's a lie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, is that one mine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, hand it over so I can open it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay. Leonard, even though I don't have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And that's a lie, right?<br>
