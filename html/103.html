<i>Sheldon</i>I've got the Sword of Asaroth!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Forget the sword, sheldon, help Raj!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There is no more sheldon. I am the sword master!<br>

<i>Leonard</i>No. I can't look at you or your avatar right now.<br>
(Laughter from the hallway)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sounds like your neighbor's home.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Excuse me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, right, right, right, right.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Stealing snail mail, very <b title='old-fashioned'>old school</b>, I like it.<br>
[Cut to the hallway]<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Penny, the mailman, did it again... he... oh, sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Um, oh, hi, Leonard. This is Doug. Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard.<br>
<i>Doug</i>What's up, bro?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not much... bro.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Is everything okay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, no, I just... I got your mail again. Here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Thank you. I've got to talk to that mailman.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, no, that's probably not such a good idea. <b title='A civil servant is sb who works in the Civil Service in Britain and some other countries, or for the local, state, or federal government in the United States.'>Civil servants</b> have a documented <b title='inclination/tendency'>propensity</b> to, you know, <b title='become angry'>snap</b>, so...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Well, thank you, again.<br>

[Cut back to the living room]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='The saying "a penny for your thoughts" is an English idiom asking people to volunteer their opinions on an issue being discussed'>Penny for your thoughts</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm fine. Penny's fine. The guy she's kissing is really fine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? <b title='not showing sexual feelings'>Chaste</b>? French?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What is wrong with you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm a romantic.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Please don't tell me that your hopeless <b title='a strong feeling of love for sb/sth, obsession'>infatuation</b> is <b title='transfer ↗evolve'>devolving</b> into pointless jealousy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not jealous. I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Because he looks better than you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. He was <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='very attractive'>dreamy</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, at least now you can retrieve the <b title='flight recorder <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Fdr_sidefront.jpg/220px-Fdr_sidefront.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder">Wiki</a>]'>black box</b> from the twisted, <b title='smolder - burn slowly without flame'>smoldering</b> wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I disagree. Love is not a <b title='a short race'>sprint</b>, it's a marathon. A <b title='"never stop"'>relentless</b> pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms... or hits you with the pepper spray.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm-I'm done with Penny. I'm gonna be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Like who?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know... Olivia Geiger?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The <b title='sb who gives people advice about what it is healthy for them to eat and drink'>dietician</b> at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Leslie Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming, one can only assume she's signaling sexual availability.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't know. You guys work in the same lab.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So?<br>
<i>Howard</i>There are <b title='unsuspected danger or difficulty'>pitfalls</b>. Trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law, I'm a bit of a self taught expert.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, howard, if I were to ask Leslie winkle out, it would just be for dinner. I'm not gonna walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, then you're probably okay.
<s>Physics lab.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hello, leslie.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Hi, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leslie, I would like to propose an experiment...<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Goggles, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. Leslie, I would like to propose an experiment.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a 500 kilowatt oxygen <b title='a dark chemical put on cuts in the skin to prevent infection'>iodine</b> laser to heat up my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_Noodles">Wiki</a>]'>cup & noodles</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've done it. About two seconds. 2.6 for <b title='a type of soup containing vegetables and small pieces of pasta'>minestrone</b>. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio- social exploration with a neuro- chemical <b title='an additional quality'>overlay</b>.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Wait, are you asking me out?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I was going to characterize it as the modification of our colleague slash friendship paradigm with the addition of a date like component, uh... we don't need to <b title='argue about small unimportant details'>quibble</b> over terminology.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>What sort of experiment would you propose?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's a generally accepted pattern in this area. I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant. Then, we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy <b title='if sth features a particular person or thing, they are an important part of it'>featuring</b> the talents of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant">Wiki</a>]'>Hugh Grant</b> or <b title='starred in Miss Congeniality and Gravity. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Bullock">Wiki</a>]'>Sandra Bullock</b>.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Interesting. Would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Heart rate, <b title='a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone">Wiki</a>]'>pheromones</b>, etc. Yes.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Why don't we just <b title='lay down as a condition of an agreemen'>stipulate</b> that the date goes well and move to the key variable?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You mean kiss you now?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can you define the parameters of the kiss?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Close mouthed but romantic. Mint?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you. (Each of them chews a mint) Shall I count down from three?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>No, I think it needs to be spontaneous. (They kiss)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>What do you think?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You proposed the experiment. I think you should present your findings first.<br>
<i>Leslie</i><b title='used to show that you understand why sb has done or said sth'>Fair enough</b>. On the <b title='used to talk about an advantage or good feature'>plus</b> side, it was a good kiss. Reasonable technique, no <b title='irrelevant'>extraneous</b> <b title='spit, saliva'>spittle</b>. On the other hand, no <b title='sexual excitement'>arousal</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>None?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>None.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah. Well, thank you for your time.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Leaves and then comes back) None at all? (Leslie shrugs her shoulders and shakes her head)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't... would you want me to tell you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That depends. When... I learn that I'm a robot... will I be able to handle it?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe. Although the history of science fiction is not on your side.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Wiki</a>]'>Asimov's three laws of robotics</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>You might be bound by them right now. (Looks at him meaningfully)<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to <b title='develop so that a particular situation exists, usu a bad one'>come to</b> harm?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course not.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, no.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I smell robot.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Enters) Hey, what's going on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Internet's been down for half an hour.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Also, sheldon may be a robot.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So how'd it go with Leslie?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean, any more than the <b title='22 minutes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Wiki</a>]'>383 miles</b> that it was gonna move anyway. (Heads to the bathroom)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just gonna be two weeks of <b title='mope - feel very unhappy and pity oneself'>moping</b> and <b title='boring'>tedious</b> <b title='a style of rock music [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo">Wiki</a>]'>emo</b> songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You could power down.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women and Leonard could have his pick.
<s>A large room. The guys participate in a dancing class.</s>
<i>Teacher</i>Remember the latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and... we <b title='move slowly from one side to another'>sway</b>. One, two, three... five, six, seven.<br>

<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good lord.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>She said, you don't know me, <b title='you do not know how I feel/face [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061230175103AATX4Gu">link</a>]'>you don't wear my chains</b>, oh, yeah. God, that's a good song.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're <b title='compile - make a book, list, record etc, using different pieces of information, music etc'>compiling</b> a mix cd for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that <b title='a wooden post covered in rough material that cat owners provide so their pets have an acceptable place to scratch [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratching_post">Wiki</a>]'>scratching post</b> is for you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know what you're thinking. I've taken your asthma into account. There's a <b title='relating to the cat family'>feline</b> <b title='sb who studies or specializes in genetics'>geneticist</b> in San Diego who's developed the cutest little <b title='hypo- - less than usual. allergen - sth that causes an allergy'>hypoallergenic</b> <b title='calico cat - a cat that has black, white, and brown fur <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Calico_cat_-_Phoebe.jpg/220px-Calico_cat_-_Phoebe.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat">Wiki</a>]'>calicos</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, listen to me...<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I've been thinking about names. I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Maybe. If it's a cute, little, <b title='A cuddly person or animal makes you want to cuddle them.'>cuddly</b> cat.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='exclamation of disbelief, displeasure or exasperation'>Come on</b>. Leonard... This is obviously about penny.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me. The woman rejected me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/HST-SM4.jpeg/300px-HST-SM4.jpeg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_telescope">Wiki</a>]'>Hubble Telescope</b> does of discovering at the center of every <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">Wiki</a>]'>black hole</b> is a little man with a flashlight searching for a <b title='a safety device which stops the flow of current to an electrical system when there is a fault ↗fuse'>circuit breaker</b>. Nevertheless, I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> feel obligated to point out to you, that she did not reject you. You did not ask her out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no, now that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='used esp by children, for expressing pleasure and excitement '>goody</b>, we're getting a cat.
<s>Hallway in front of apartments.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh... no. (Knocks on Penny's door)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good afternoon, penny. So, hi... hey. Uh... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, you mean dinner tonight?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There is an inherent ambiguity in the word "dinner." <b title='according to a strict way of understanding the meaning of sth'>Technically</b> it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed.<br>
So to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Supper?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Or dinner. I was thinking 6:30 if you can go. Or a different time?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, 6:30's great.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? Great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Us guys?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj. Who all's coming?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>They... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there. <b title='algebra - a type of mathematics that uses letters and other signs to represent numbers and values'>Algebraically</b> speaking, there are <b title='2 ^ 3 = 8 (--- --R -H- -HR S-- S-R SH- SHR)'>too many</b> unknowns. For example, Sheldon had <b title='a franchised fast-food restaurant brand which specializes in offering toasted submarine sandwiches. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiznos">Wiki</a>]'>Quiznos</b> for lunch. Sometimes he finds that <b title='food that is filling makes you feel full quickly'>filling</b>, other times he doesn't. It's no fault of Quiznos, they have a varied menu.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, whatever. It sounds like fun.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great. Did we say a time?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Six thirty.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>And that's still good for you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's fine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='because'>'Cause</b> it's not <b title='not changeable or subject to change'>carved in stone</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, 6:30's great.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'll get my chisel.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Why?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>To... carve the... Okay, I'll see you 6:30.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>How do I look?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Could you be more specific?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can you tell I'm <b title='perspire =sweat'>perspiring</b> a little?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. The dark <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Crescent.svg/167px-Crescent.svg.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent">Wiki</a>]'>crescent</b> shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Six thirty.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Perfect. That gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of <b title='a fragrance produced by Estée Lauder'>Aramis</b> to <b title='vanish'>dissipate</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is it too much?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not if you're a rugby team.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>By the way, if it <b title='used to talk about sth that may possibly happen or be true'>should</b> ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken <b title='Chicken, Smoky Bacon, All-Natural Mozzarella, Sautéed Mushrooms, Parmesan Alfredo Sauce, Served on your choice of Artisan Breads: White, Wheat, Rosemary Parmesan or Jalapeno Cheddar [<a href="http://www.quiznos.com/Menu/all-natural-chicken-sub-sandwiches/Chicken-Carbonara.aspx">link</a>]'>carbonara sub</b> at Quiznos.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would I join you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no, well, now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment; it could go well.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course there is the other possibility, that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall, until one of you breaks down and moves to another <b title='a short sequence of letters and numbers at the end of your address, which helps the post office to sort the mail'>zip code</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You could've stopped at "it could go well."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If I could've, I would've.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant, and have a lovely dinner, maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common. You love pottery? I love pottery! There's a pause, we both know what's happening. I lean in, we kiss. It's a little <b title='done without confidence =hesitant'>tentative</b> at first, but then I realize she's kissing me back. She's biting my lower lip! You know, she wants me! This thing is <b title='go the (full) distance - finish sth you have started'>going the distance</b>! We're gonna have sex! Oh, god, oh, my god!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is the sex starting now?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm having a panic attack.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, okay. Uh, well then... calm down.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If I could calm down, I wouldn't having a panic attack; that's why they call it a panic attack!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, all right. Uh, would you just s-s-sit down. Yeah, sit down and now close your eyes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Just do it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, uh, try to increase your <b title='one type of brain waves [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave">Wiki</a>]'>alpha wave</b> activity.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's a biofeedback technique. It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation. I read a paper about it in Journal of American Neuroscience. It was a little <b title='sparse - existing only in small amounts'>sparsely</b> sourced, but I think the basic science is valid. I probably have it here somewhere.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Who am I kidding? I can't <b title='finish an unpleasant task'>go through with</b> this. You need to call her and cancel.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What should I tell her?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not the kind of illness that will make her <b title='want to'>wanna</b> come over and take care of me, but-but nothing so <b title='very ill'>critical</b> that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I wanna try this again.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Got it. So I'm assuming nothing <b title='caused or spread by sexual activity with another person ↗VD'>venereal</b>? I'll just tell her that you had a routine <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy">Wiki</a>]'>conoloscopy</b> and haven't quite <b title='recovered'>bounced back</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Give me the phone. (Snatches the phone out of his hand)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I thought you wanted to cancel.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't, because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why would she be expecting me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Stop asking me all these questions. I need to take another shower.
<s>A restaurant.</s>
<i>Penny</i>So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, yeah... no. It turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon... had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding. Well then that's something we have in common.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We both have people in our lives who... want to <b title='nip sth in the bud - prevent sth from becoming a problem by stopping it as soon as it starts'>nip</b> intestinal <b title='polyp - a small lump that grows inside your body because of an illness, but is not likely to harm you'>polyps</b> in the bud.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So, what's new in the world of physics?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? Nothing?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, with the exception of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">Wiki</a>]'>string theory</b>, not much has happened since the 1930s. And you can't prove string theory.<br>
At best you can say, "hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ah. Well, I'm sure things will <b title='become better, improve'>pick up</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's new at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cheesecake_Factory">Wiki</a>]'>The Cheesecake Factory</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Citrus_aurantiifolia_of_Kadavoor.jpg/220px-Citrus_aurantiifolia_of_Kadavoor. jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_lime">Wiki</a>]'>key lime</b> that's moving pretty well.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good. Good. Uh what about your, uh... hallway friend?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Doug? Oh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...<br>
wt Can I get you started with some drinks?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No! (Makes a funny noise and motions her to leave; to Penny) You were saying? But...<br>
<i>Penny</i>(To the waitress) I'd like a drink.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just say the "but" thing about Doug and I'll get her back.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, I don't know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this breakup with Kurt and this thing with Doug would just be <b title='sb who is on the rebound is upset or confused because their romantic relationship has just ended'>rebound</b> sex.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, don't get me <b title='begin to complain or be annoying in some way'>started</b> on rebound sex.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's just... it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b> guy, and then it's just 36 meaningless hours of... you know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not sure that I do. Uh... is that one 36-hour experience, or is that 36 hours spread out over, <b title='suppose sth as an example'>say</b>... one <b title='very pleasant, enjoyable'>glorious</b> summer?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, <b title='chafe - become sore by rubbing'>chafing</b>, right?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Emotionally.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you wanna see something cool? I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Physics. (Makes the olive spin in the glass)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow, <b title='the apparent force that draws a rotating body away from the center of rotation. It is caused by the inertia of the body as the body&#039;s path is continually redirected. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force">Wiki</a>]'>centrifugal force</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Actually, it's <b title='a force that makes a body follow a curved path: its direction is always orthogonal to the velocity of the body, toward the fixed point of the instantaneous center of curvature of the path. Centripetal force is generally the cause of circular motion. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force">Wiki</a>]'>centripetal force</b>, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive... (Drops the olive) Excuse me. (Goes under the table to find it) If you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-inertial_reference_frame">Wiki</a>]'>non-inertial reference frame</b> and would... (Bangs his head against the table)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you okay?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not okay.

<i>Penny</i>Are you sure you don't wanna go to the emergency room?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, no, I'm okay. It stopped bleeding.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a <b title='injury to the brain caused by a blow, violent shaking, etc'>concussion</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes. But I get car sick, too, so...<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry about your car, by the way.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, it's fine. You got most of it out the window.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, me too. Well, um, good night.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good night.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Was this supposed to be a date?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>This? No. No, of course not. This was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up 'cause of work and a colonoscopy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I was just checking.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When I take a girl on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital 'd'. Boldface. Underlined. Da... ted. I think I might have a little concussion. I'm gonna go lie down. Good night.

<i>Sheldon</i>So, how was your date?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Awesome!<br>
