<i>Sheldon</i>Here's the problem with <b title='the technology for sending people and objects very quickly from one place to another '>teleportation</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title="tell me what you're saying, be more clear">Lay it on me</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Assuming a device could be invented, which would identify the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state">Wiki</a>]'>quantum state</b> of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title="Isn't that surprising">How about that</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Personally, I would never use a transporter, because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, he would be exactly the same.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That is a problem.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So you see it too.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Dr. Hofstadter. Dr. Cooper.<br>
<i>Leonard & Sheldon</i>Dr. Gablehauser.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Gentmen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly <b title='wanted by a lot of people but rare or difficult to get'>sought-after</b> doctoral candidate, and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Graduate work. Very impressive.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>And he's only 15 years old.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Not bad, I <b title='used for emphasis'>myself</b> started graduate school at 14.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Well, I lost a year while my family was tunneling out of North Korea.<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='In tennis, advantage is when one player wins a point from a deuce and needs one more point to win the game'>Advantage</b>, Kim.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around. Let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>I already know you're not. You don't have an <b title='...which facilitates distributed computing for scientific research [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Science_Grid_Consortium">Wiki</a>]'>Open Science Grid</b> computer or a <b title='a type of laser [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-electron_laser">Wiki</a>]'>free-electron laser</b>, and the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">Wiki</a>]'>string theory</b> research being done here is nothing but a <b title='a situation from which no more progress is possible'>dead end</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, that is my research, and it is <b title='not at all'>by no means</b> a dead end.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Well, obviously you don't <b title='notice, understand'>see</b> it yet, but trust me, you will.<br>
(Sheldon gets upset and tries to stand up, but Leonard pushes him on the shoulder, making him sit back)<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Dennis, we've discussed this. We're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to <b title='ignore sth that is happening and not try to stop it'>look the other way</b> if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to <b title='take sb/sth illegally from one country to another'>smuggle</b> your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here, boys. (To Sheldon and Leonard) Make it happen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, sir.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You can <b title='depend on'>count on</b> us. We're <b title='taking part in an activity'>on</b> it. (To Dennis) What the hell do you mean "dead end"?<br>
<i>Dennis</i>I mean, the whole <b title='situation'>landscape</b> of <b title='a term in in quantum field theory [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum">Wiki</a>]'>false vacuums</b> in string theory could be as large as <b title='10 ** 500'>ten to the five hundredth power</b>. In addition- ooh, look, chocolate milk. (Goes to the vendor machine)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='↗[<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Disturbance_in_the_Force">Star Wars Wiki</a>]'>I sense a disturbance in the force.</b><br>

<s>The hallway outside Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So Dennis, how long have you been in America?<br>
<i>Dennis</i>A year and a half.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No kidding. You speak english really well.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you talking <b title='a preposition'>about</b>?<br>
<i>Dennis</i>That.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>He's not wrong. All right. And this is my office.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Is this part of the tour?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nope. Goodbye. (Opens the door and enters his office)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Follows him) Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All... right. This is my desk. These are my books; this is my door. Please close it behind you. Goodbye. (Sits down in his chair)<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Keen observation. Goodbye.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>You see where you went wrong, don't you?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Smiling) Yeah?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Get him out.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, Dennis. (Pats him on the back) I-I'll show you the <b title='recreation'>rec</b> center. They've got <b title='American exercise equipment company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus, _Inc.">Wiki</a>]'>Nautilus</b> equipment.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Do I look like I lift weights?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Not heavy ones.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>It's <b title='very unusual or surprising'>startling</b> to me you haven't considered a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_invariant">Wiki</a>]'>Lorentz invariant</b> or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_theory">Wiki</a>]'>field theory</b> approach.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Stands up and walks over to the board) You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Have you considered it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Get him out, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Come on, Dennis. I'll show you the radiation lab.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>(Follows Leonard and notices a plaque) Wow, you won the <b title='[<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130204181245AAI0IDp">link</a>]'>Stevenson award</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. In fact, I am the youngest person ever to win it.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Really? How old?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fourteen and a half.<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Hmm, you were the youngest person ever to win it. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's like looking into an <b title='very offensive, unpleasant, or rude'>obnoxious</b> little mirror, isn't it? (Smiles and leaves)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Penny</i>(To Raj) This is really delicious, isn't it? (Raj nods) Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh? Oh, sweetie, (Rubs him on the arm) you are so damaged.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, I'm damaged, too. How about a hug for Howie?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure. Raj, hug Howard. (Raj casts a look; Howard shakes his head)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Something you'd like to share? A tale of <b title='great sorrow or distress'>woe</b>, perhaps?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is 15 years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today, I went from being <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart">Wiki</a>]'>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b>, to... you know, that other guy.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='In the 1780s while Mozart lived and worked in Vienna, he and his father Leopold wrote in their letters that several "cabals" of Italians led by Salieri were actively putting obstacles in the way of Mozart&#039;s obtaining certain posts or staging his operas. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Salieri">Wiki</a>]'>Antonio Salieri</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh god, now even you're smarter than me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why waste food? In Texas, when a cow goes <b title='not supplying liquid'>dry</b>, they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I'm confused. Did Sheldon stop giving milk?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would <b title='appear/arrive'>come along</b> who was younger and smarter.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, but I assumed I would've been dead hundreds of years and that there'd be an <b title='* (used esp to show sth interesting or important)'>asterisk</b> by his name because he'd be a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">Wiki</a>]'>cyborg</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>So you've got a little competition. I really don't see what the big deal is.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, of course you don't. You've never excelled at anything.<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends <b title='in/at the beginning'>in the first place</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We liked Leonard. (Raj nods)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, what are you gonna do, Sheldon, just give up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes. It's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is <b title='invalidate - show that sth is wrong'>invalidated</b> by a <b title='a pubescent boy or girl is going through puberty'>post-pubescent</b> Asian <b title='a young person who is extremely good at sth'>wunderkind</b>. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do we <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> shoot him between the eyes?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Excitedly) Hey!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've decided you're right. My career is not over.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But since the arrival of Dennis Kim has <b title='render - casuse sth to be'>rendered</b> my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Happily) Great!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So I've decided I'm going to collaborate with you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Icily) Great.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So what exactly is it you do? (Leonard looks at him incredulously) I know you <b title='talk continuously in a fast informal way, usu about unimportant subjects'>chatter on</b> about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study <b title='[<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021916957900855">link</a>]'>the soft component of cosmic radiation</b> at sea level, but I really don't need any help.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, sure you do. (Pulls his chair over and sits next to Leonard) Now, see, what's this here in the <b title='a structural or procedural diagram, especially of an electrical or mechanical system'>schematic</b>? Is that a laser array?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, hm... (Leonard looks at him and then gets back to work) What happens if you use <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon">Wiki</a>]'>argon</b> lasers instead of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium">Wiki</a>]'>helium</b>-<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon">Wiki</a>]'>neon</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It would blow up.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Pretty sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>"Pretty sure" is not very scientific. Is this how you normally work? Just <b title='hunch - base sth on intuition or instinct and not on evidence'>hunches</b> and guesses and stuff?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive, but I need to tell you something, and I want you to listen carefully.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Go away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, your name can go first (Leonard turns over and looks at him, annoyed) (Wheels his swivel chair away) I'm going.
<s>Howard's lab.</s>
<i>Howard</i>It's a small, brown paper bag, ma! I'm looking in it right now! Why would I make that up? There's no <b title='chocolate cake [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_dong">Wiki</a>]'>Ding Dong</b> in it. How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Standing in the doorway) So... this is engineering, huh?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'll talk to you later.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Engineering. Where the <b title='excellent'>noble</b> <b title='possessing some skills but not enough to do specialized work'>semiskilled</b> <b title='sb whose work needs physical strength'>laborers</b> <b title='carry out, perform'>execute</b> the <b title='an idea of what you think sth should be like'>vision</b> of those who think and dream. Hello, <b title='knee-high beings in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oompah_loompah#Oompa-Loompas">Wiki</a>]'>oompah loompahs</b> of science.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, what are you doing here?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I just came by to say hello.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I've been in this lab for three years. You've never come by to say hello.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, up until now, I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?<br>
<i>Howard</i>A small payload support structure for a European science experimeal package that's going up on the next space shuttle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Really? How does it work?<br>
<i>Howard</i>When this is done, it will be attached to the payload <b title='the part of a ship or plane where things are stored'>bay</b>, and the sensor apparatus will <b title='lie or be placed on'>rest on</b> it. (Demos it)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Uh-huh. So it's a shelf.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, you don't understand, during acceleration, it needs to stay perfectly <b title='flat and not sloping in any direction'>level</b> and provide... yeah, okay, it's a shelf.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now, I notice you're using <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium">Wiki</a>]'>titanium</b>. Did you give any consideration to <b title='Not to be confused with Carbon fiber [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube">Wiki</a>]'>carbon nanotubes</b>? They're lighter, cheaper, and have twice the <b title='able to be stretched without breaking'>tensile</b> strength. (Messes with something on Howard's table)<br>
<i>Howard</i>(Lifts Sheldon's hand up) Sheldon, there's a <b title='an official document that proves you have successfully finished all the work in a course of study'>diploma</b> in my office that says I have a master's in engineering.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Picks up a note and reads) And you also have a note from your mother that says, "I love you, Bubula." But neither of those is a <b title='convincing; strong'>cogent</b> argument for titanium over nanotubes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Go away!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Did Leonard tell you to say that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I thought of it all by myself.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Huh. (Leaves and thinks aloud) That can't be a coincidence. There must be some <b title='a link between two things in which one causes the other'>causal link</b> I'm missing.
<s>Raj's office.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Go away!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Comes out Raj's office) <b title='curious - strange/unusual'>Curiouser</b> and curiouser.
<s>The living room. Leonard is working at his desk.</s>
<i>Howard</i>(Pokes his head around the door) Is he here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If he were, I wouldn't be.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Do you know what he did? He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Is that even possible?<br>
<i>Raj</i>As it turns out, yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Something's got to be done about him, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Like what? He'll never be able to <b title='in dealing with a difficult problem or situation'>cope</b> with the fact that some 15-year-old kid is smarter and more <b title='skilful, expert'>accomplished</b> than he is.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Then our problem would be solved.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no.<br>
<i>Howard</i>We don't have to go that far. There are other means available.<br>
<i>Raj</i>We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Won't happen. He is not interested in anything but physics.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What about biology?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, biology. (Imitates a seductive hot girl) The one thing that can completely <b title='cause (a train) to go off the rails'>derail</b> a world-class mind.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, he's 15.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, so? When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri and my <b title='GPA [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_point_average">Wiki</a>]'>grade point average</b> fell from a 5.0 toto a 1.8.<br>
<i>Raj</i>She was sleeping with you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Enters) Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could <b title='defeat'>lick</b> <b title='a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">Wiki</a>]'>cold fusion</b> in less than a <b title='10 years'>decade</b>. 12 years, <b title='at the most'>tops</b>.<br>
(Howard, Raj, and Leonard stare at him without saying anything)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Go away? (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me?
<s>Hallway in front of apartments. Howard, Raj, and Leonard are at Penny's door.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, hey guys, what's up?<br>
<i>Howard</i>We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl <b title='have/with a thing for/about - have very strong feelings'>with a thing for</b> smart guys.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard, that's racist. Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.<br>
(Penny slams the door in disgust)<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's possible she may have misunderstood us.
<s>Sheldon's office.</s>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, no. Please come in. Yeah, I think you'll <b title='value highly'>appreciate</b> this. This is very exciting.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Oh, what are you working on?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, (To Kim) Thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look. I'm going to solve the Middle East crisis by building an exact <b title='exact copy'>replica</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem">Wiki</a>]'>Jerusalem</b> in the middle of the Mexican desert.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i><b title='for what purpose'>To what end</b>?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, it's like the baseball movie. "<b title='Field of Dreams is a 1989 American fantasy-drama film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_dreams">Wiki</a>]'>You build it and they will come.</b>"<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Who will come?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The Jewish people.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>What if they don't come?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We'll make it nice, <b title='make available'>put out</b> a <b title='a large meal for several guests on a special occasion'>spread</b>.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Okay, well, um... speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr. Kim who's agreed to join us here at the university.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course he has. The oracle told us little <b title='Neo is the 5th one [<a href="http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/The_One">Wiki</a>]'>Neo was the one</b>. (Waves his hands in front of Dennis) You can see the Matrix, can't you?<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Okay, well, obviously you're very busy with your, uh, um... come, Dennis. (Leaves and closes the door; in the hallway) You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper. He's been under a lot of, um... he's <b title='crazy'>nuts</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Sings in his office) Ay yay yay yay, <b title='Jewish "Let us rejoice" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hava_Nagila">Wiki</a>]'>hava nagila</b>, they'll come, they'll settle, and I'll win the prize.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb. Why wouldn't the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora_desert">Wiki</a>]'>Sonora desert</b> make a perfectly good <b title='the land promised or given by God, according to the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible), to the Israelites [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_land">Wiki</a>]'>promised land</b>?<br>
<i>Professor Goldfarb</i>Go away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We could call it <b title='Spanish "new"'>nuevo</b> Jerusalem.<br>
<i>Professor Goldfarb</i>Go away. Please go away.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Said pharaoh to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Wiki</a>]'>Moses</b>.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Why are all these young women here?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's take your daughter to work day.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Really? I was not aware of that.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, yes. There was a very official e-mail that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='awesome, cool ↗Smooth Criminal'>Smooth</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you.<br>
(Dennis Kim enters)<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>There's the man of the hour.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, so we now have a socially-awkward genius in a room full of attractive, age-appropriate women.<br>
<i>Howard</i>All he has to do now is <b title='meet sb and become friendly with them'>hook up with</b> one of them.<br>
(Dennis stands alone, scratches his arm, and then pickes his ear)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?<br>
<i>Raj</i>We need a social catalyst.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Like what? We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Or can we?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, we can't.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't think you mean "we can't." I think you mean "we shouldn't."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Approaches) Hey, Howard, you're a Jew. If there was another <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wailing_wall">Wiki</a>]'>wailing wall</b> exactly like the one in Jerusalem but close to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco">Wiki</a>]'>taco</b> <b title='stand - stall'>stands</b> and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it?<br>
(Leonard, Howard and Raj stare at him)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, it's definitely me. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, we cannot leave this to chance. Let's pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, how about that one?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I know the type. Cheerleader, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_council">Wiki</a>]'>student council</b>, goes out with the <b title='a jock is a young man who is enthusiastic about a particular sport and spends a lot of time playing it'>jocks</b>, won't even look at anybody in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifted_education">Wiki</a>]'>gifted program</b>. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a <b title='a situation in which someone cheats or tricks you'>setup</b> and you're in the backseat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you...<br>
<i>Raj</i>Are you crying?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I have allergies.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, um, oh, hey, how about her?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure, if he wants to spend a couple years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a <b title='the condition of being unable to think or act normally'>stupor</b> with nonfat <b title='A White Russian is a sweet cocktail [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Russian_%28cocktail%29">Wiki</a>]'>white russians</b>. And you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes "more guys were like you." And then she gets into <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell">Wiki</a>]'>Cornell</b> because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, so not her, either. Oh, how about her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby, so probably low self-esteem.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That's our girl. One of us should go talk to her.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I can't talk to her, you do it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='no'>I don't know</b>, she'll never <b title='be attracted by, like, prefer'>go for</b> the kid once she gets a peek at this. (Pushes his pecs out)<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, if we were in India, this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats and a laptop, and we'd be done.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, we're not in India.<br>
<i>Raj</i>All right, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically <b title="spend one's time dreamily thinking about sb one loves">moon over</b> her for months on end.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, that was <b title='not fair or suitable'>uncalled-for</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You started it, dude.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Could I have everyone's attention, please? What a wonderful occasion this is, and how fortunate that it <b title='describing a situation that may possibly happen'>should</b> happen to fall on take-your-daughter-to-work day. We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim to our little family.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Welcome, Dennis Kim.<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Mr. Kim was not only the <b title='the student who has received the best marks all the way through school, and usually makes a speech at the graduation ceremony'>valedictorian</b> at Stanford university, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stevenson Award.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>And now, <b title='without delaying or wasting any time'>without any further ado</b>, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr. Dennis Kim. (Everyone applauds) Dennis? Dennis!<br>
<i>Dennis</i>What?<br>
<i>Dr. Gablehauser</i>Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research?<br>
<i>Dennis</i>Oh no, thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma. (They leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The kid got a girl.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Unbelievable.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did anyone see how he did it?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To Dr. Gablehauser) Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and gentlemen, honored daughters, while Mr. Kim, <b title='as a result of'>by virtue of</b> his youth and <b title='the state of being naive '>naivety</b>, has fallen prey to the <b title='that cannot be explained'>inexplicable</b> need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to <b title='puzzle'>baffle</b> and <b title='disgust'>repulse</b> me. Thank you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>He's back.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, mission accomplished.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Forget the mission. How did that little <b title='dork'>yutz</b> get a girl on his own?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Then why do we go home alone every night? We're still smart.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Maybe we're too smart.<br>
So smart it's <b title='unpleasant; disturbing'>off-putting</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, let's <b title='select, choose'>go with</b> that.
<s>A park.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Unbelievable. Components I built are on the international space station and I get a <b title='official notice of an offence against sth, usu traffic regulations'>ticket</b> for launching a model rocket in the park.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman, "you have to <b title='search sb with your hands'>frisk</b> me. I have another rocket in my pants."<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, look at that. It's Dennis Kim. (He drinks from a bottle in a paper bag)<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. (He and girl kiss passionately)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, we really ruined his life.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to express irritation'>Screw</b> him; he was weak.
