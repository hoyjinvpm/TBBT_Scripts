<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Smell that? That's the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>They're on me today, boys.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I'm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz zero-gravity Waste Disposal System.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, get over yourself. It's a high-tech toilet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just think, thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.<br>
<i>Howard</i>ls that supposed to be funny?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe it is. The combination of Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double meaning of the verb "to <b title='use toilet'>go</b>" suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space <b title='the work of fitting and repairing water pipes, baths, toilets etc'>plumbing</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, make your little jokes. But of the four of us, I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.<br>
<i>Raj</i>He's right. This is an important achievement for two reasons: <b title='pee'>Number one</b>, and of course, <b title='poo'>number two</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, clever. Playing on the use of <b title='↗ordinal'>cardinal</b> numbers as <b title='euphemism - a polite word or expression that is used to refer to things which people may find upsetting or embarrassing to talk about'>euphemisms</b> for bodily functions.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Here, Sheldon. I <b title='pull - take sth out; succeed in doing sth illegal or dishonest'>pulled</b> the new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy">Wiki</a>]'>Hellboy</b> for you. It's <b title='very impressive, exciting, or shocking'>mind-blowing</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, <b title='a message or report that is intended to ruin the surprising part of a popular film, book etc by telling people about the surprise before they see or read it'>spoiler</b> alert.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>But I didn't spoil anything.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You told me it's mind-blowing, so my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Send <b title='How the Grinch Stole Christmas [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinch">Wiki</a>]'>the Grinch to Christmas</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. What's up?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Remember when I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, <b title='↗vividly'>vaguely</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure, you remember. That was the night you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What about it?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Well uh, the thing is, the date didn't go that well.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Too bad. You know what, I guess the thing to do now is just seem, <b title='get up from the ground after you have fallen'>pick yourself up</b>, dust yourself off, forget it, and move on.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>I can't do that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why the hell not?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>'Cause we're going out again tomorrow.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Excuse me, Stuart? Have you read the new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flash_%28comic_book%29">Wiki</a>]'>Flash</b>?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I have, and it will <b title='surprise and please you by being very impressive'>knock your socks off</b>. Good luck getting <b title='socks'>them</b> back on.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Uh. Anyway, yeah, I figure this is probably my last <b title='chance'>shot</b> with Penny and I don't wanna <b title='screw up - do sth badly or spoil sth'>screw it up</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, nobody wants that.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>So here's my question: It's the second date. You think she'll be expecting things to get <b title='↗PE'>physical</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, gee. Um, my initial reaction is "no". But, you know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay. So, you'll give me a call?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, or you call me.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Great. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Or nobody calls anyone.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Interesting, Penny's current <b title='a man who wants to marry a particular woman ↗courtship'>suitor</b> asking advice from her former suitor.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, thanks for <b title='closed-captioned - broadcast with captions that can be seen only on a specially equipped receiver'>closed-captioning</b> my pain, Raj.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, you wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm listening.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
<s>First floor of the buidling.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Penny</i>How's it going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good, good. You?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Fine. Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know your friend Stuart?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, he asked me out again and I said yes. And then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>About what?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, does it bother you? Me going out with one of your friends? 'Cause, you know, you and me-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. No, that's the past. I'm really more of a right now kinda guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future 'cause, well, that's my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future, so- In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, that's really cool of you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah? Well, I wouldn't say cool. I'd just say, "That's Leonard."<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>About Stuart? Love to.<br>
<i>Penny</i>He's very shy. How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, yeah. Stuart <b title='thrive - become very successful or very strong and healthy ↗thrust'>thrives</b> under pressure. That's why he works in a comic-book store.
<s>The cafeteria. Phone ringing.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. It's Stuart. (Phone ringing)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're not going to answer it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He wants to talk about Penny. I don't wanna talk about Penny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire. And he needs your assistance.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would he call me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We don't know. And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Answer the phone, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. (Phone chiming) There. It went to voicemail.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Aren't you going to check your messages?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You have to check your messages, Leonard. The leaving of a message is one half of a social contract, which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down. And we descend into anarchy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It must be hell inside your head.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>At times.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Guys, we have a code red.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean code red, the hospital emergency alert? code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of <b title='a carbonated soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew">Wiki</a>]'>Mountain Dew</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I was going over the <b title='schematic - A structural or procedural diagram'>schematics</b> on my Zero-G Toilet and I made a teeny-tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How teeny-tiny?<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But the mission is for six months.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, see, that's the code red. It's kind of like a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack-in-the-box">Wiki</a>]'>jack-in-the-box</b>. No one knows exactly when, but at some point, something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Have you notified NASA?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No! Are you crazy? What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So what are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, what do you need us for?<br>
<i>Raj</i>He can't figure out how to fix it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You said you were gonna be supportive.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm trying. But you have to admit, this is pretty damn funny.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I agree. It's a <b title='juxtapose - put things which are not similar next to each other'>juxtaposition</b> of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the <b title='banal - trivial'>banality</b> of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the <b title='funny'>comic</b> <b title='people or things that are useful for the stated purpose'>fodder</b> here. (Laughs. To Leonard) Check your messages.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz zero-gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Don't you mean the Wolowitz zero-gravity Human Waste Distribution System?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good one, yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It's hilarious. Now. Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this, so the waste material avoids the spinning <b title='an engine or a machine that uses the pressure of liquid or gas on a wheel to get power'>turbine</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yeah, I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of <b title='diminish - decrease'>diminishing</b> comedic returns with space poop.<br>
(Someone knocks on the door and Leonard answers it)<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Stuart.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>You busy?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh-<br>
<i>Howard</i>Classified, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's a regular <b title='a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Wiki</a>]'>Manhattan Project</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's up?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Well, tonight's my date with Penny. And since we haven't been able to connect by phone-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I'm sorry. It's been broken.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Or e-mail.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, that's broken too. Everything's broken.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right. Well, <b title='just guessing or using my memory, without taking time to think carefully'>off the top of my head</b>, you know, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, <b title='extremely slow ↗glacier'>glacial</b>.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, guys come on to her all the time, so you need to, like, <b title='set apart - make different'>set yourself apart</b>, you know? Be a little shy. Don't make too much eye contact. And you know, treat her with, like, cool <b title='the state of not reacting to or being involved in sth in an emotional way'>detachment</b>. And-and, you know, fear.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Fear?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Like you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Well, that <b title="fits comfortably into my area of expertise. In baseball jargon, the wheelhouse is the sweet spot of a baseball player's strike zone where the most power and strength can be utilized">plays right into my wheelhouse</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Good, good. Well, you-you kids have fun tonight.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Thanks, Leonard. (Points at Howard's thing) What is that thing anyway?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You don't know what this is?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Good, get out. (Closes the door)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Be afraid of Penny. Nice, very <b title='cunning, sly'>crafty</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It wasn't bad advice. It just wasn't particularly helpful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='used to emphasize that what you are saying is only your own opinion or suggestion and may not be very helpful'>For what it's worth</b>, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.<br>
[Continued from earlier.]<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, what if we use this two-inch <b title='a type of plastic, used to make pipes, window frames, clothes etc'>PVC</b> to reinforce the center cross-support?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a <b title='very large'>hearty</b> potato-based diet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I feel terrible.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course you feel terrible. You completely <b title='screw up - ruin'>screwed up</b> your <b title='the belief that your actions in this life affect all your future lives [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma">Wiki</a>]'>karma</b>, dude.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's not superstition, it's practically <b title='the work of Isaac Newton'>Newtonian</b>. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend, and acts like a two-faced bitch. Therefore, he is reborn as a banana <b title='a small creature with a soft body [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug">Wiki</a>]'>slug</b>. It's actually a very elegant system. You know, what goes around comes around.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Speaking of what goes around comes around (Motions him to the thing)<br>
<i>Raj</i>Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypassed it entirely?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What if we reposition the collection tank?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It won't work. No way to mount it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That could work.
<s>The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny's door.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Morning.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Morning. What's up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Nothing. We just <b title='pull - perform a displeasing action'>pulled</b> an <b title='an event that lasts all night'>all-nighter</b> trying to fix a zero-gravity <b title='an Italian food made from flour and water, and sometimes eggs'>pasta</b> maker. I'm gonna make a coffee <b title='a trip to acquire sth'>run</b>. Do you want any?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Great, so how'd it go with Stuart last night?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, I really don't wanna talk about it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Right. Sure. But, you know, the thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and I-<br>
<i>Penny</i>I said I don't wanna talk about it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. Okay, I just, I kinda feel responsible-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Look, Leonard. What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?<br>
<i>Raj</i>If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my <b title='fucking'>freaking</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte">Wiki</a>]'>latte</b>.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Hang on, I think I've got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I think you're overestimating the <b title='of tension'>tensile</b> strength of the substructure you're building.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Howard, wait. Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the <b title='used to describe sth that is at right angles to sth else; situated across sth'>transverse</b> filter assembly in place?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is that what that's for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course we also have <b title='unrestrained'>rampant</b> poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera so a little cardboard in our cheese <b title='to not be important or not matter'>is no biggie</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Where you going?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Comic book store.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, an excellent idea. I <b title='could use - want very much'>could certainly use</b> a break.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hold on, you guys can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why does Leonard get to go?<br>
<i>Howard</i>'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny. And if I have to hear about it again, I'm gonna kick him in his <b title='ovary - the part of a female that produces eggs'>ovaries</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks for understanding, Howard.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I got your back, sister. All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupperware">Wiki</a>]'>Tupperware</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Wow, that's heavy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Damn right, it's heavy. It's my mother's <b title='meat, herbs, and other foods mixed and baked together in the shape of a loaf'>meatloaf</b>. It's been testing toilets for generations.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might <b title='give sb the right to have or to do sth'>entitle</b> you to a <b title='an amount of money that is given back to you'>refund</b> on your Master's degree.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meatloaf analog. In three, two, one. (It jumps out of the toilet)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fascinating.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What do you think the problem is?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not enough bread crumbs.
<s>The comic book store.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Sure, what's up?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think I gave you some bad advice about Penny and I want to apologize.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No, your advice was great.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It was?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're kidding. Never worked for me.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Yeah, last night at dinner I did what you told me. I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>It doesn't matter. 'Cause that's where it all went to hell.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>No, everything was good and really hot. And I said, oh, Penny, and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said, your name.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Leonard?<br>
<i>Stuart</i>That is your name, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. No, yeah. Wow, I'm sorry. That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Well, it beats "You know I'm a dude", right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Not your fault.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, how about that? See you soon.<br>
<i>Stuart</i>Yep, sure. (Leonard "dances" right after he leaves the store.)
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Howard</i>(On phone) Yes sir, I understand. Classified. We'll keep it all classified. No one has to know anything about this but you and me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's classified?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, they've deployed our solution. Let's just all hope it works.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't see why I have to worry. My career's not hanging in the balance. (Smiles) That was a joke. It's funny because it's true.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm sorry, were you talking to me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I said Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, you did, didn't you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What the hell is that?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Meatloaf.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What was it doing on the ceiling?<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's classified.
<s>International Space Station.</s>
<i>Astronaut</i>Houston, uh, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.<br>
<i>Man</i>I.S.S, Houston, which crew members would be involved in this <b title='Extra-vehicular activity'>E. V.A</b>?<br>
<i>Astronaut</i>Houston, uh, we all like to step outside for a few minutes.<br>
<i>Man</i>I.S.S, I'm afraid we can't authorize that.<br>
<i>Astronaut</i>Uh, Houston, uh, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the dock.
