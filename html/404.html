<i>Raj</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, if <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon">Wiki</a>]'>xenon</b> emits ultraviolet light, then those <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">Wiki</a>]'>dark matter</b> discoveries must be wrong.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you'd be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my <b title='buttocks'>derrière</b> would produce cotton candy, and <b title='Star Wars Episode I [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace">Wiki</a>]'>The Phantom Menace</b> would be a <b title='continuing for ever'>timeless</b> classic.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, you're so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's like if <b title='Alien vs. Predator is a science fiction horror franchise [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator_%28franchise%29">Wiki</a>]'>Alien and Predator</b> decided to go partners in a <b title='a restaurant retailer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamba_Juice">Wiki</a>]'>Jamba Juice</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Has it occurred to you you're missing <b title='the situation as a whole'>the big picture</b>? If you look at neutron scattering data-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Penny? Penny?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) No, no, no. He won. <b title='deal with sth displeasing'>Suck it up</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me. Howard won't order anything, but he will come up with some sort of <b title='gross / creepy / icky'>skeevy</b> comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard's lactose intolerant, so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_modelling">Wiki</a>]'>balloon animal</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hang on a second. I could have the <b title='several types of fruit served on a large plate'>fruit platter</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You want the fruit platter?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Does it have melon on it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, I can't eat melon.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Howard, <b title='a warning'>heads-up</b>. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>When was the last time you saw her?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I gonna play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, <b title='not expressing an opinion or decision'>noncommittal</b>? Cold and <b title='not very friendly / reserved ↗introverted'>distant</b>? (Hides under table).<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Hi, guys.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.<br>
<i>Raj</i>It's one of his best moves.

<i>Howard</i>So, my dear, we meet again.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Hello, Howard. I've missed you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I've missed you, <b title='an American actress best known for playing Lieutenant Kara "Starbuck" Thrace on Battlestar Galactica [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katee_Sackhoff">Wiki</a>]'>Katee Sackhoff</b>.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>One question.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Anything.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Sorry. Oh, <b title='rape'>ravish</b> me, Howard. My loins <b title='want to do or have sth very much ↗craving, longing'>ache for</b> you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, if you insist.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Howard, have you seen my <b title='a piece of women&#039;s underwear that fits tightly around the stomach and hips [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girdle">Wiki</a>]'>girdle</b>?!<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, Ma!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I can't find it, and I'm late for my <b title='an international company based in the United States that offers various products and services to assist weight loss and maintenance [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_Watchers">Wiki</a>]'>Weight Watchers</b> meeting!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernadette? What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Well, if I had to guess, I'd say I'm here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you're still hung up on me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, I'm not.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we'd be done by now.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, I'm a little confused here.<br>
<i>George Takei</i>Oh, my. Can I help?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Not that kind of confused.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What's <b title='an American actor, director and author, originally known for his role as Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the USS Enterprise in the television series Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Takei">Wiki</a>]'>George Takei</b> doing here?<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, of course not.<br>
<i>George Takei</i>So you say. Yet, here I am.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being <b title='always given the same kind of character to play'>typecast</b> as a science fiction icon?<br>
<i>George Takei</i>It's difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do <b title=' a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Strindberg">Wiki</a>]'>Strindberg</b>, <b title='Eugene Gladstone O&#039;Neill was an Irish American playwright and Nobel laureate in Literature [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_O%27Neill">Wiki</a>]'>O'Neill</b>, but all they want is, Course <b title='lay - calculate/plan a course [<a href="http://www.subzin.com/s/Course+laid+in">quotes</a>]'>laid</b> in, Captain.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i><b title='used to say that you understand what sb is talking about and have had the same experience'>Tell me about it</b>. It's <b title='fucking ↗freaking'>fracking</b> frustrating.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>She's leaving because you really wanna be with me.<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!<br>
<i>Howard</i>Great, Ma!<br>
<i>Mrs Wolowitz</i>I think it shrunk! I'm <b title='spill out - leave'>spilling out</b> like the <b title='an advertising icon and mascot [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillsbury_Doughboy">Wiki</a>]'>Pillsbury Doughboy</b> here!<br>
<i>Howard</i>And with that mental picture, I think we're done for the evening.
<s>The university cafeteria.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I did a stupid thing.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I guessed that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It was the kind of thing that makes it kinda hard to face her now.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You <b title='↗hit, bump, run down/into'>ran over</b> a <b title='sb who travels around and has no home or regular job'>hobo</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. Stop asking.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, fine. So you wanna get back together with her, but you're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='in a very clear way, using few words'>In a nutshell</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You're being unreasonable. Why can't I have a desk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don't need desks.<br>
<i>Raj</i>You have a desk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Correct.<br>
<i>Raj</i>But I can't have one.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're <b title='two question and two correct answers'>two for two</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient, there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of <b title='a brand of red licorice candy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Vines">Wiki</a>]'>Red Vines</b>, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super <b title='expensive'>executive</b> <b title='a vivarium which is designed primarily for the study of ant colonies and how ants behave [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formicarium">Wiki</a>]'>ant farm</b> with glow-in-the-dark sand?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, what if he buys his own desk?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's ridiculous.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Because-<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's my office.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.<br>
<i>Raj</i>And I can put it in your office?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, you really wanna <b title='take care of every detail (from handwritting the lowercase letters i and t)'>dot the I's and cross the T's</b>, don't you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>They do some of their best work at night.
<s>Penny's apartment. She is gathering laundry.</s>
<i>Penny</i>(Picking up a <b title='↗topless'>top</b> and sniffing it) Ah, it's okay.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny? Penny? Penny? (She opens door. Howard is stood outside with a hand-held voice recorder.) Penny?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, absolutely.<br>
<i>Howard</i>She does?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?<br>
<i>Howard</i>She saw that, huh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we're on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, I'd rather not say.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Howard, if you want my help, I've gotta know what happened.<br>
<i>Howard</i>But it's embarrassing.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that's what I'm <b title='count on - expect'>counting on</b>. <b title='spill your guts - tell sb all about your private life, or about a personal secret'>Spill</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?<br>
<i>Penny</i>The online game? Sure.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Her name was Glissinda the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll">Wiki</a>]'>Troll</b>. Bernadette <b title='walk in on - go into a room and accidentally interrupt sb who is doing sth private that they would not want you to see ↗walk out (on)'>walked in on</b> me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Would you talk to her?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bernadette or the troll?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, what was your side?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman. I mean, she could've been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Really? And that didn't make her feel better?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all we could get back together?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't wanna get in the middle of this.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No. Why would you? I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any <b title='piece, fragment'>scrap</b> of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, I will think about it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You know, I've always blamed myself, for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, I said I'd think about it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of <b title='not looking healthy and strong'>sickly</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thank you.
<s>A corridor at the university.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>One question.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why on earth are you telling me all this?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you're not a real boy.<br>
(Sheldon opens his office door. It bangs against a desk. Inside, Raj is sat behind a huge, <b title='covered with a lot of decoration ↗ornament'>ornate</b> antique wooden desk in an enormous antique <b title='a chair that rotates'>swivel chair</b>.)<br>
<i>Raj</i>You said I could buy a desk.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>This isn't a desk. This is a <b title="Brobdingnag is a fictional land in Jonathan Swift's satirical novel Gulliver's Travels occupied by giants.">Brobdingnagian</b> <b title='sth that is very large and very ugly'>monstrosity</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's actually British.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Can you say it again for me?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Brobdingnagian.<br>
<i>Raj</i>One more time?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Brobdingnagian.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Now three times fast?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna- How did you even get it in here?<br>
<i>Raj</i>That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, you've made your point. A fine <b title='practical joke'>prank</b>, very amusing. Now get it out.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, if you're not going to remove it, I'll remove it for you.<br>
<i>Raj</i><b title='work very hard in order to do sth well. knock sb out - make sb become unconscious or go to sleep'>Knock yourself out</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Help me move my desk.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. It's too Brobdingnagian.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, seeing as its purpose was to <b title='piss off - annoy sb very much'>piss you off</b>, I'd say it's <b title='exactly right'>spot-on</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, I see what's going on. This is the opening <b title='firing of several guns at the same time'>salvo</b> in what will be an <b title='↗escalator, elevator, lift'>escalating</b> series of <b title='childish'>juvenile</b> <b title='sth you do to harm sb because they have harmed you'>tit-for-tat</b> exchanges. Well titted.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Stand by for my upcoming tat.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, Sheldon?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
<s>The Cheesecake Factory.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>Sorry, I had to clock out.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, no, that's okay. How've you been?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Same. I took a <b title='underwater breathing apparatus'>scuba</b>-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Too bad.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You wouldn't know anybody who wants to buy a <b title=' a close-fitting rubber suit which an underwater swimmer wears ↗bathing suit, swimsuit'>wet suit</b>, boy's large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, to be honest, I-<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Uh, not for me, thanks.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I'm okay.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Are you gonna wanna order food?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Maybe later.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So, are you seeing anybody?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No.<br>
<i>Penny</i>That's what I told him when he asked me. I hope that's not out of line.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>No, it's fine.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Penny, can we have a little privacy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. I'm sorry. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What about you, have you been seeing anybody?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>So you've been seeing other girls?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Well, not real girls.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Does that mean slutty trolls?<br>
<i>Penny</i>You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>It's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passiflora_edulis">Wiki</a>]'>passion fruit</b>, new on the menu.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I know. I work here.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sorry. Yeah, you're right. <b title='to imply stupidity, slow to understand, obtuseness'>Doy</b>. So, Howard, trolls, <b title='yea or nay - yes or no'>yay or nay</b>?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Isn't there somewhere else you can be?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Not where I can hear you guys.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Okay, fine. I'll admit, there are dark, <b title='dirty and unpleasant; involving immoral or dishonest behavior'>sordid</b> little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in <b title='speaking very quietly ↗shush, shh'>hushed</b> tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I've ever gone there is because I don't have a real woman in my life. You happy?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that'll hold me for a while.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll's brains out.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, but we weren't, I-I mean, you and I never-<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Had sex?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, whose fault was that?<br>
<i>Penny</i><b title=' given free of charge'>Complimentary</b> <b title='a Mexican dish of tortilla chips [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachos">Wiki</a>]'>nachos</b>! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you mean, whose fault was that?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Well, we could've been having sex, but you never made the move.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I didn't think you wanted me to make the move.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy <b title='fast, continuous, and usually amusing talk'>patter</b> and your tight <b title='skin-tight black pants'>hoochie pants</b> if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Really.<br>
<i>Howard</i><b title='used when you are annoyed or surprised'>Son of a bitch</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you're ready. (Puts down the check)
<s>University corridor.</s>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we're gonna start seeing each other again.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Did Penny tell you about that?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. Steve Patterson told me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How'd he know about it?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>He's Glissinda the troll.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>So anyway, that's great news about you and Bernadette.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah. I think I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that's like regular golf.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Short jokes? Really? You're, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, and don't you forget it.

<i>George Takei</i>Mm-mmm. Too soon.<br>
<i>Katee Sackhoff</i>Trust me, she's ready. Make the move.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>Mm! What're you doing?<br>
<i>Howard</i>You said, well, the move, remember?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, not now. We're starting a new relationship. I need to <b title='gradually know'>get to know</b> you again.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Oh, God, what's that smell? (Knocks on Sheldon's door. Sheldon answers in a gas mask). Oh-ho-hoo!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you doing in there?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm making hydrogen <b title='a compound of sulphur and another chemical element'>sulphide</b> and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.<br>
