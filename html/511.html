<i>Penny</i>(Entering) Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's "Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi." No spaces.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. If you can't get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I believe that you're capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day">Valentine&#039;s Day </a>]'>Valentimes Day</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You wanna hear something weird?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary <b title='The Harlem Globetrotters is an exhibition basketball team. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Globetrotters">Wiki</a>]'>Harlem Globetrotter</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. I thought it was a game.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What's yours?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He's in town and wants to have drinks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or, the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world <b title='slam dunk - when a basketball player jumps high above the net and throws the ball down through it'>slam dunking</b> to <b title='a jazz standard (a song or other piece of music which has been popular and often played over a long period of time) and pop tune [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Georgia_Brown">Wiki</a>]'>Sweet Georgia Brown</b>. Pick.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Basketball Pope.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And that's how it's done.<br>
<i>Penny</i>What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Is this the fellow who peed in your <b title='a brand of fruit punch (a drink made from fruit juice, sugar, water, and usu some alcohol) drinks [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Punch">Wiki</a>]'>Hawaiian Punch</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, that was a different guy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was he the one who <b title='A wedgie occurs when a person&#039;s nether underwear or other garments are wedged between the buttocks. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedgie">Wiki</a>]'>wedgied</b> you so hard, your testicle <b title='re + ascend [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle">Wiki</a>]'>reascended</b>, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, that was a different, different guy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister.<br>
<i>Penny</i>All right, well, what do you think he wants?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can <b title='cause sth to enter and become fixed in sth'>lodge</b> the other testicle up there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I told you. That was a different guy.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hmm. That's too bad. We could've spent <b title='ball - testicle; The Times Square Ball is a time ball located in New York City&#039;s Times Square. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square_Ball">Wiki</a>]'>New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop</b>.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>It's two a.m. What are you doing up?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure. You wanna see what all the scientists are wearing this year.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look at these men. They've managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum <b title='underpin - give support, strength or a basic structure to sth'>underpinnings</b> of the expansion of the early universe than <b title="ain't got the brains God gave a squirrel/ain't got the sense God gave geese - very foolish">God gave a goose</b>. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>So, what's got you up? Did you have a bad clam?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I didn't have clams.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't watch you 24 hours a day. I don't know what you do.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wear <b title='loafer - a flat leather shoe that does not need to be fastened onto your foot [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip-on_shoe">Wiki</a>]'>loafers</b>. Look at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Perlmutter">Wiki</a>]'>Dr. Saul Perlmutter</b> up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What's the matter, Saul? You afraid someone's gonna steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should've said in high school. You know, <b title='choose sb (esp repeatedly) for punishment, criticism or blame'>pick on</b> someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might've <b title='lift - steal'>lifted</b> it.
<s>Penny's bedroom.</s>
<i>Bernadette</i>I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>'Cause when I wear it, it's a shirt. So, what's Howard doing tonight?<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four <b title='sb who competes in mathematics competitions at any level or any age. The term is a portmanteau of the words math and athlete.'>mathletes</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>When Leonard gets back, I'd love to check his <b title='a chemical in the body that helps carry messages from the brain and is believed to make you feel happy'>serotonin</b> levels. Do you think he'd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hmm, he's not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it'll just pour out of his nose.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I don't think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, that's awful.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Worst part was, it was too big.<br>
<i>Amy</i>That's nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put <b title='a hair-regrowth medication'>Rogaine</b> in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wow. You poor thing.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What about you?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. I don't know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn't really have bullies.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, we weren't really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Oh, my God, that's awful.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Did Kathy Geiger laugh?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kinda had an <b title='The leafy stalk produces ears which contain the grain, which are seeds called kernels.'>ear</b> of corn in her mouth.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Who would've thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?<br>
<i>Penny</i>What? I was not a bully.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Kinda sounds like you were. And maybe a <b title='sb who has committed a serious crime such as murder or robbery'>felon</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Shh. That's how you <b title='end up'>wind up</b> in a cornfield.
<s>A bar.</s>
<i>Raj</i>Is that him over there?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No.<br>
<i>Raj</i>How about that guy? He looks like he'd hate you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know, I can really do this by myself.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Hey, we're here to support you, buddy.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, you're not. You're here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You wore underwear? You fool.<br>
<i>Raj</i>So, have you figured out what you're gonna say to him?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he <b title='pull - perform a displeasing action'>pulled</b> on me in school.<br>
<i>Howard</i>That's quite a list. I can't read your handwriting, what's that word?<br>
<i>Leonard</i><b title='the bag of skin that contains the testicles in men and most male animals'>Scrotum</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's that one?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, stapled.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>(Arriving) Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, th-this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Fellas. (To the bartender) Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you're a <b title='highest or most successful'>big-time</b> scientist now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And there's the first <b title='a clever humorous remark that might also be insulting'>zinger</b>. Ouch.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm doing okay, I guess.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Okay? Come on, I read online you're a physicist at a university, you won some medal.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The Newcomb medal.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Yeah, congratulations.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That's the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, good Lord, are we gonna stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>My point.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>You should've seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I can't take all the credit. You helped a lot.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Yeah. We were <b title='almost, virtually'>practically</b> a comedy team.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Like the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death">Wiki</a>]'>Black Death</b> and Europe.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a <b title='nerd'>gearhead</b> to get it to the finish line.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Technically, Howard's the gearhead. Leonard's just a <b title='a retail store that sells a wide range of inexpensive household goods.'>dime store</b> laser <b title='sb who operates a specified vehicle, machine, or device'>jockey</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the idea?<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>This is just between us, right?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?<br>
<i>Raj</i>That sounds amazing. First movie I'm watching, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie#Theatre_and_film">Wiki</a>]'>Annie</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How exactly would these glasses work?<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>How the hell should I know? That's why I need a nerd.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I don't think something like that's even possible.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You're like the smartest guy I've ever known.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a <b title='sth esp bad'>doozy</b>. Leonard, you can't live in fear of this man forever.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, I got this.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You clearly don't. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you're a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his <b title='present from or before birth ≠acquired'>congenital</b> lack of masculinity.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, I <b title='friendly but not involving sex [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato</a>]'>platonically</b> love you, man, but face it, you're a <b title="sb who isn't good at life">mess</b>.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>You're doing great.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Bye. Gosh, no one wants to hear my apologies.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they'd melt.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>Penny, it doesn't matter what you did in the past. You're a good person now.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You weren't just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.<br>

<i>Penny</i>Okay, come on, I don't even have my own house, I'm gonna build one for someone else?<br>
<i>Amy</i>How about donating some of your clothes?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, my God, that's perfect. 'Cause I have so many clothes I don't wear, and they're just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>What about helping people?<br>

<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, we can't let him drive.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Not really, no. It's funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we're reversed. You're the winner.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>You mind if I use your bathroom?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, just back there.<br>
<i>Howard</i>How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know what would be nice?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What's that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who've tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn't say we should do it.

<i>Penny</i>Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.<br>
<i>Bernadette</i>I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.<br>

<i>Bernadette</i>Donated.<br>

<i>Jimmy</i>Man, I <b title='tie one on - get very drunk'>tied one on</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And, and, and thanks for the apology.<br>

<i>Jimmy</i>Geez, you're still <b title='harp on - keep talking about sth in a boring or annoying way'>harping on</b> that? What a <b title='a girl or young woman'>puss</b>.<br>

<i>Jimmy</i>It's good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not going to say I told you so, but we could've killed him.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I might kill him right now.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The <b title='a nickname for the superhero Batman'>Dark Knight</b> has your back. He's scared, but he <b title='supporting you'>has your back</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.<br>
<i>Jimmy</i>Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.<br>
