<i>Sheldon</i>Worst <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">Wiki</a>]'>Renaissance</b> <b title='↗carnival, funfair'>fair</b>, ever!<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Please let it go, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was <b title='full of'>rife with</b> historical inaccuracies. For example, the <b title='inn; bar'>tavern</b> girl serving <b title='flagon - a large container for liquids with a handle'>flagons</b> of <b title='alcoholic drink made from fermented honey and water'>mead</b>. Now, her costume was obviously <b title='used to describe the ancient culture and language of the peoples of northern Europe'>Germanic</b>, but in 1487, the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria">Wiki</a>]'>Bavarian</b> purity laws, or <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Wiki</a>]'>Reinheitsgebot</b> severely limited the availability of mead. At best, they would've had some sort of spiced wine.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're <b title='nitpick - criticize small unimportant details of sth in a way that annoys other people ↗nag'>nitpicking</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh-ho-ho, really? Well, here's another <b title='nitpick - pick nit. Or an egg of a louse'>nit</b> for you. The flagons would not have been made of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene">Wiki</a>]'>polypropylene</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking <b title='slightly fat in a way that looks healthy and attractive'>chubby</b> girls who work at <b title='a chain of stores that provide a retail outlet for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground (including Home Delivery) shipping, as well as printing, copying, and binding services. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinko">Wiki</a>]'>Kinko's</b> and lacing them up in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsets">Wiki</a>]'>corsets</b> so tight their <b title='chest, breasts'>bosom</b> jumps out and says "<b title='hello'>Howdy</b>."<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy" in the 15th century. If anything, they would've said, "<b title='used to to express joy, encouragement, or triumph'>Huzzah</b>."<br>
<i>Howard</i>I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon. I just wanna be part of the conversation.<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Comes down the stair with a guy) Hi, guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. <b title='Otherwise you are crazy guys.'>I'm hoping</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Renaissance fair? More of a medieval-slash-<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Wiki</a>]'>Age of Enlightenment</b>-slash-any-excuse-to-wear-a-<b title='penis amplifier [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codpiece">Wiki</a>]'>codpiece</b> fair.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, fine, whatever. Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.<br>
<i>Guys</i>Hello. Hi.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Hey.<br>
(Awkward silence)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, yeah, good to see you.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too. (To Eric) We should probably go.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Bye, guys.<br>
<i>Eric</i>(To Howard) Like your hat.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks, my mom made it. (Penny and Eric leave) Penny with a new guy. <b title='Spanish "very"'>très</b> awkward.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It wasn't awkward. Wasn't fun. Besides, what's the big deal? We dated, we-we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.<br>
<i>Raj</i>By "moving on, " you mean she's going out with other men and you spend the afternoon making 15th century <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap#Medieval_Europe">Wiki</a>]'>soap</b> with Wolowitz?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That was not 15th century soap. My god, those people need to learn you can't just put "<b title='the'>ye</b> <b title='old'>olde</b>" in front of anything you want and expect to get away with it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Can we please just go in? My <b title='armor made from metal rings'>chain mail</b>'s stuck in my underwear.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You're wearing modern underwear?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I <b title='fashion - shape or make, using your hands or only a few tools'>fashioned</b> historically accurate undergarments out of linen.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You went out and bought linen?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't be silly. I borrowed one of your pillowcases.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Borrowed?
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what, I'm happy that Penny's moving on. It gives me freedom to move on myself.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Are you saying that you've been holding back?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Of course. Out of respect.<br>
<i>Howard</i>So how do you explain the 10 years before Penny?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Who were you respecting then?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What? I've dated plenty of women. There was, uh, Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary: The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, what about that girl last year at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Con#United_States">Wiki</a>]'>Comic-Con</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>lt doesn't count.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Raj</i>What happens in costume at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You're only saying that because of what happened to you.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What happened to you?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nothing happened to me.<br>
<i>Howard</i>It wasn't your fault, Raj. He was dressed as <b title='<img src="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081206022845/memoryalpha/en/images/thumb/e/ec/Vina_as_an_Orion_slave_girl.jpg/180px-Vina_as_an_Orion_slave_girl.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Orion_slave_girl">Wiki</a>]'>a green Orion slave girl</b>.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Well, how did we get on me? We were mocking Leonard for not moving on. (To Leonard) Dude, you have totally not moved on.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes, I have. It's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Like who?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, there's Joyce Kim. But she <b title='defect- leave a country, political party, or organization and go to another one'>defected</b> back to North Korea so, it's a little geographically undesirable.<br>
<i>Raj</i>What about Leslie Winkle?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, no.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Why?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Her research methodology is <b title='done in a careless and untidy way'>sloppy</b>, she's <b title='completely wrong and unacceptable'>unjustifiably</b> arrogant about <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">Wiki</a>]'>loop quantum gravity</b>, and to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I think she's <b title='extremely hot'>smoking hot</b>.<br>
<i>Howard</i>I'd <b title='When a hot girl walks past, "I&#039;d hit/tap that" means they would have sex with her if they ever had a chance. [<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110729143905AAvpxq7">link</a>]'>hit that</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You'd hit <b title='relating to or consisting of extremely small particles'>particulate</b> soil in a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_suspension">Wiki</a>]'>colloidal suspension</b>. (Howard looks at him) Mud.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah? So? Be a tool. Go get yourself a little <b title='in a state of recovering from rejection, disappointment, etc'>rebound</b> stress release.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Techincally, it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.<br>
<i>Howard</i>You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I bought him dinner and we kissed once. That was it. And he told me his name was <b title='a very popular first name for females and also a very popular last name for all people'>Kimberly</b>.
<s>The cafeteria.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know how I know we're not in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_%28franchise%29">Wiki</a>]'>Matrix</b>?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>How?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If we were, the food would be better. (Throws something back into his plate in disgust) (Cypher: You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.

(Leslie walks over)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey, Leslie.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(To Sheldon) Hey, <b title='stupid person'>dummy</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Ooh, rush me to the <b title='burn - a witty or otherwise impressive insult. A burn unit is a hospital specializing in the treatment of burns'>burn unit</b>. (He can't make a retort) Hey, Leonard, do you have a second? I need to ask you something. (Sits down)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Stands up and moves on) Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go do work that promises significant results as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me. (Dumps the tray noisily, drops it, picks it up, and then leaves)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Wow. So I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like <b title='frozen sewage material [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_ice_%28aircraft%29">Wiki</a>]'>blue ice</b> falling out of an airplane lavatory.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Where'd you hear that?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me. (Show him her cellphone)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Reads the text) "Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory, " yep.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one. I gave him an "<b title='laughing out loud'>LOL</b>."<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Anyway, it got me thinking. Now that you're <b title='not having a girlfriend/boyfriend'>unattached</b>, maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Are you suggesting another <b title='a boxing or wrestling match'>bout</b> of stress release?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>No, I'm all done with casual sex. From now on I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship <b title='pattern, model'>paradigm</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really? What changed?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I'm tired to say there's just a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a <b title='traditional Japanese bedding [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futon">Wiki</a>]'>futon</b> with a bunch of people she doesn't know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, I can see how that would- A bunch of people?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Anyway, I just figure it's time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Your place. We'll order Chinese. You'll rent a movie, artsy but <b title='easy to understand and enjoy'>accessible</b>. Then light <b title='the activity of kissing and touching someone as part of a sexual activity'>petting</b>, no <b title='sexual intercourse'>coitus</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sounds fun.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I'll leave the details up to you. I think it's better if you <b title='undertake'>assume</b> the male role.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Sarcastically) Thank you, that's very thoughtful.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Great. (Teasingly) Call me. (Leaves)
<s>The living room. Leonard is preparing the date.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Enters with a big box) Great news. My mom sent me my old <b title='N64, a home video game console [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64">Wiki</a>]'>Nintendo 64</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh. Terrific.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You know what this means, don't you? <b title='bring out'>Break out</b> the <b title='an energy drink [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull">Wiki</a>]'>Red Bull</b>. It's time to <b title='use an object well'>rock</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario">Wiki</a>]'>Mario</b> <b title='do sth in a way that is more in line with traditional technique'>old-school</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I kinda have other plans tonight.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But it's Friday. Friday's always vintage-game night. Look, Mom included the memory card. We can <b title='start again, continue'>pick up</b> right where I left off in 1999 when I had <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernicious_anemia">Wiki</a>]'>pernicious anemia</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>The thing is, someone's coming over.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, no problem. I have three controllers. The more the merrier.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, it's a date. I have a date coming over.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh. Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Why? What's so unusual about me having a date?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, statistically speaking-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, all right. Nevertheless, I have one now and I'd appreciate it if you would, you know, <b title='go away. or, scarce - rare'>make yourself scarce</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am a <b title='publish - bring to the public attention'>published</b> theoretical physicist with two doctors and an lQ which can't be measured by normal tests. How much scarcer could I be?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You know what I mean. Could you just give us a little privacy?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You want me to leave the apartment?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>You mean just go someplace else and be- someplace else?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But why should I leave? This is my apartment too.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I know it is. And if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy, I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, all right, then.
<s>The staircase. Penny goes down the stairs.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon? What are you doing?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Playing "Super Mario" on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Wait-wait, why are you doing it on the stairs?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I am a modern-day <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon">Wiki</a>]'>Napoleon</b> exiled to the <b title='Napoleon was forced to abdicate and go in exile to the Italian island of Elba.'>Elba</b> of the staircase because Leonard, (To Mario) get this, (to Penny) has a date.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh. Oh, it's good for him. You know, why are you sitting here? Why don't you just go to a movie or something?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Alone?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, why not?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What if I choke on my popcorn? Who will administer the <b title='Abdominal thrusts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimlich_maneuver#Abdominal_thrusts">Wiki</a>]'>Heimlich maneuver</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Then don't order popcorn.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No popcorn at the mov? Listen to yourself.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ok. Why don't you go to a coffee shop?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't drink coffee.<br>
<i>Penny</i>They have other things.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Intrigued) What do they have?<br>
<i>Penny</i>I don't know. You know, cookies, <b title='Pastry is the name given to various kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry">Wiki</a>]'>pastries</b>-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Pastries such as <b title='a sweet breakfast pastry [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_claw_%28pastry%29">Wiki</a>]'>bear claws</b>?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Yeah, sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't like bear claws.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(Enters) Hey, Penny. (To Sheldon) <b title='stupid person'>Dumb ass</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, they have a lot in common. I mean, they're both scientists.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, <b title='used when you think what sb has just said is unreasonable'>please</b>. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed <b title='[<a href="http://www.space.com/16065-space-chimp-ham.html">Wiki</a>]'>sending chimps into space</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, I have a date too, so, I'll see ya. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Peach">Wiki</a>]'>Princess Peach</b>. And what am I doing? I'm just enabling you.
<s>The living room.</s>
<i>Leslie</i>This is pretty good orange chicken.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, it's from Chang's.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Not Chow's?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No, Chang's.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>What happened to Chow's?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>lt <b title='changed name'>changed</b>.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>So, how many children do you think we should have?<br>
(Leonard chokes and coughes)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I'm sorry, that was a little <b title='sudden; rude'>abrupt</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>A little?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I mean, there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I sure hope so.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?<br>
(Sheldon enters)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry to interrupt. Battery's dying. Continue.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, genetic weaknesses, right. Um, there's the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance">Wiki</a>]'>lactose intolerance</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Don't forget the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-pattern_baldness">Wiki</a>]'>male-pattern baldness</b>. When his uncles sit around the dinner table, they look like a half-carton of eggs. (Leaves with a power strip which has a very long cable, and unfortunately, still not long enough)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay yeah, (Stands up and goes over to close the door) my uncles are bald, but my aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet, so, sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.<br>
(Sheldon knocks on the door and now enters)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What now?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I have to make pee pee. (Leonard motions him to go to the bathroom)
<s>Continued from earlier. Leslie is leaving.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>Listen, I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions. He can be a bit of an <b title='sb who behaves in a way that is different from what is usual or socially accepted'>eccentric</b>.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>If by "eccentric" you mean "<b title='indirect expression of hostility [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive%E2%80%93aggressive_behavior">Wiki</a>]'>passive-aggressive</b> East Texas <b title='↗asshole'>blowhole</b>, " I agree.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I think tonight was a very good start.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Me too. You're sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial <b title='viable - able to work as intended or able to succeed'>viability</b> test?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No problem. I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Yes. I believe <b title='a system of rules about the correct way to behave on an official occasion'>protocol</b> <b title='determine'>dictates</b> that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not <b title='repulse - disgust'>repulsed</b> by your <b title='too sweet or sentimental'>cloying</b> eagerness.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Again, it's your decision. You're the man.<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, it wasn't my cat. It was an experiment designed by this guy named <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger">Wiki</a>]'>Schrodinger</b>.<br>
<i>Guy</i>From the <b title='the protagonist of the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brown">Wiki</a>]'>Charlie Brown</b> cartoons?<br>
<i>Penny</i>No, he was some kind of scientist. Let me start again. Oh, hey, Leonard.<br>
<i>Guy</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Leslie.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Hi.<br>
(Penny and the guy leave)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, good night. (Kisses her)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, well, good night. (Grabs the guy by the head and kisses him)<br>
<i>Leslie</i>That ain't gonna make your point. (Kisses him passionately) (Penny cast a glance at them and there is a fierce kiss contest) Okay, that's enough. (Swings her body seductively) Call me. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Right. (Goes into his apartment and closes the door)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, okay, good night.<br>
<i>Guy</i>What?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Had a great time. <b title='Italian "goodbye" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciao">Wiki</a>]'>Ciao</b>.

<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Come on, Sheldon. There are so few places I can wear my <b title='sb in the past whose job was to entertain an important person by saying and doing funny things'>jester</b> costume.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't care. There are far too many historical <b title='anomaly - sth that is different from what is normal or expected'>anomalies</b> for my comfort.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Oh, okay, how about this? You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Intrigued) You mean like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock">Wiki</a>]'>Spock</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Fascinating.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Comes over) Hey, fellow scientists. Sheldon.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mm. Why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yeah, let's do it.<br>
(Sheldon pouts and doesn't move. Leonard looks at him)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>If you're having trouble deciding where to sit, may I suggest <b title='Leslie Winkle Experimental Methodology'>One Potato, Two Potato</b>? or as I call it, the Leslie Winkle Experimental Methodology.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Don't make this hard for me.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's not hard. It's simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You're right, it is simple. (Goes over to sit with a scientist he might have sex with)

<i>Sheldon</i>Penny.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Third floor tonight. <b title='mix up - change the way things have been arranged'>Mixing it up</b>? (Sheldon pulls the cable of his power strip to show Penny it isn't long enough) Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you don't just go to dinner or something.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, let's say I go to dinner alone and during the meal I have to use the restroom. How do I know someone's not touching my food?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Excuse me?<br>

<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, come back. <b title="I don't understand what you're saying. I can't follow what you're saying">You're losing me</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It's Leslie Winkle, Penny. She <b title='make sb/sth seem little'>belittles</b> my research.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>She called me "dumb-ass."<br>
<i>Penny</i>I know, I heard.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Given the situation I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your <b title='made or done without careful thought'>ill-considered</b> relationship with Leonard.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, gee, well, thank you, for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. That response is unacceptable to me.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, you are a smart guy. You must know-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Smart? <b title='140 and over - genius; 110-120 - superior intelligence; 90-110 - normal or average intelligence [<a href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQBasics.aspx">link</a>]'>I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as "smart."</b><br>
<i>Penny</i>(Angrily) Are you gonna let me talk?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Penny</i>You must know that if Leonard and Leslie wanna be together, nothing you can do is gonna stop it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Scornfully) You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, let me put it this way. If you're really Leonard's friend, you'll support him no matter who he wants to be with.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Wait a minute. Why am I doing all the <b title='↗receiving, sharing'>giving</b> here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Because love <b title='trump - win'>trumps</b> hate.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, now you're just making stuff up.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay. Good night, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
<s>The living room. Leonard and Leslie are kissing. Sheldon enters.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>When the two of you reach a natural stopping point, I'd like to have a word.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>If the word is "pee-pee, " just do it.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Leonard, you're my friend, and friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I will <b title='behaving in a pleasant, polite, calm way'>graciously</b> overlook the fact that she is an arrogant, <b title='below a standard'>subpar</b> scientist who believes <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">Wiki</a>]'>loop quantum gravity</b> better unites <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Wiki</a>]'>quantum mechanics</b> with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">Wiki</a>]'>general relativity</b> than does <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">Wiki</a>]'>string theory</b>. (LQG better unites QM with GR than ST does) You kids have fun.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm listening. Amuse me.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Okay, well, for one thing, we expect quantized space-time to manifest itself as many new differences in the <b title='[<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071227181608AADoCom">link</a>]'>speed of light for different colors</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='nonsense'>Balderdash</b>. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(To Leonard) Are you gonna let him talk to me like that? (Stares at him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>No, there isn't. Only loop quantum gravity calculates the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>]'>entropy</b> of black holes.<br>
(Sheldon snorts. Leslie wheels around and glares at him)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, don't make that noise. It's disrespectful.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I should hope so. It was a snort of <b title='the opinion that sb/sth is stupid, unimportant, or useless ↗disdain, contempt, ridicule, mockery'>derision</b>.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>(To Leonard) You agree with me, right? Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Well, I'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Truth? What truth? We're talking about untested hypotheses- Look, it's no big deal.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>Oh, it isn't? Really? Tell me, Leonard, how will we raise the children?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I, I guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.<br>
<i>Leslie</i>We can't let them choose, Leonard, they're children! (Grabs her purse and storms off)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Wait, where are you going?<br>
<i>Leslie</i>I'm sorry. I could've accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade. But this? This is a deal breaker. (Slams the door)<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Goes over to Leonard and sits next to him) Look on the bright side.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the bright side?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Only nine more months to Comic-Con.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(Happily) Oh, yeah.
<s>A fair. The guys are in costume. Sheldon's in Spock's costume, watching a gauge in his hands.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>(To no one) Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, that's great. You guys want <b title='a hot dog sausage coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_dog">Wiki</a>]'>corn dogs</b>?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>That's a <b title='of time'>tempora</b>l anomaly. Corn dogs didn't come into existence till the first half of the 20th century.
