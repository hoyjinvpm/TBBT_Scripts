<s>The apartment. Sheldon's mother is visiting.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>It's called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian <b title='a magazine that is produced four times a year'>Quarterly</b> gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>You're <b title='miss out - fail to benefit from sth useful or enjoyable by not taking part in it'>missing out</b>. It's gonna be <b title='continuous; happening or existing all the time or everywhere'>wall-to-wall</b> fun. It's all themed. There's <b title='Jesus implies that Jonah&#039;s restoration after three days inside the great whale prefigures His own resurrection. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah#The_story_of_Jonah">Wiki</a>]'>Jonah and the Whale</b> Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favorite, Gunning with God.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, it is a <b title='intense joy'>hoot and a half</b>. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air, and you <b title='crush sth into a fine powder'>pulverize</b> them with a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_%28bore_diameter%29">Wiki</a>]'>12-gauge</b> shotgun full of our Lord's forgiveness.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>For example, if Shelly was aboard, he'd write "smart mouth" on his pigeon, and then bam!<br>
<i>Sheldon</i><b title='a play on the biblical quotation "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away"'>The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away</b>. Well, Mom, according to my <b title='a plan of a journey'>itinerary</b> for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Sounds delicious.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it. (To Leonard) You are in for a treat. My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn't wanna cook.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she's too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Won't that spoil our appetites for the chicken you're going to make me?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>All right, that settles it, we're going out. Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>I've never had it, but there's no harm in trying something new.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>There's a lot of harm in trying something new. That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he's fine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Told you.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.
<s>A sushi bar.</s>
<i>All</i><b title='a more polite version of irasshai, an imperative form of the honorific verb irassharu (いらっしゃる) which means "to be/come/go"'>Irasshaimase!</b><br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Stop yelling! I'm not happy about this.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What's the last thing you were ever happy about?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>The prospect of fried chicken.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it's just cut up fish sticks and a <b title='a small amount of food'>side</b> of <b title='a brand name for parboiled (parboil - boil food until it is partly cooked) rice and other related food products [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben%27s_%28rice%29">Wiki</a>]'>Uncle Ben's</b>. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don't make it sushi.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was <b title='a pejorative term sometimes employed by speakers of English to mock or play on the Chinese language, people of Chinese ancestry [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching_chong">Wiki</a>]'>ching chong</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yeah, yeah, that, too.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>So, Shelly, what's up with you and your friend Amy, if you don't mind a mother <b title="pry - try to find out information about other people's private lives in a way that is annoying or rude">prying</b> a bit?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, there's actually big news on the Amy <b title='field of activity'>front</b>. She's been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Do you have any idea what's going on with those two?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>It's kind of like the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster">Wiki</a>] loch - lake'>Loch Ness monster</b>. Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't. We'll probably never know. But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uh, yeah, it's Raj's sister. It's kind of tough. She's in India. Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can't force things. You need to figure out if you're in a relationship or if you're just calling it one. It's like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make <b title='kittens'>'em</b> biscuits.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to <b title='a brand of shortening (fat that is used for making pastry) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisco">Wiki</a>]'>Crisco</b>, but you can't make your mother fry it.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Sheldon, you <b title='annoy sb, esp by asking them sth many times'>pester</b> me one more time about chicken, I will <b title='and smack your ass'>put you over my knee</b> right here in this restaurant.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Please pester her. Please, for me.
<s>The stairwell.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>So, Mrs Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>It was good. The only thing that would've made it better is if it was cooked, and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord gonna fix the elevator?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I don't know. Lately we've been talking about converting it into a missile <b title='underground place where missiles are kept ready for firing'>silo</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Your son seems to think we need to launch a <b title='done to stop sb taking action'>pre-emptive</b> strike on <b title='"Media Capital of the World" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California">Wiki</a>]'>Burbank</b>.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Get them before they get us.<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer) Hey, look who decided to show up.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Raj, what are you doing?<br>
<i>Raj</i>I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.<br>
<i>Raj</i>Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Well, it's so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>We don't say that, either. I'll make you a list.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, that would be <b title='very strong and powerful'>mighty</b> white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?<br>
<i>Raj</i>Nothing, I'm fine.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Are ya?<br>
<i>Raj</i>No. (Bursts into tears)<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>That's better. Now tell me what's bothering you.<br>
<i>Raj</i>I'm so lonely.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It's a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you'll excuse my mother, she's about to make a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecan">Wiki</a>]'>pecan</b> pie that'll be so good I'll almost forget how she <b title='blow it - completely fail a task'>blew it</b> with the fried chicken.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'. What do we do when someone's hurtin'?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Offer them a hot beverage.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>And when they're drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Coffee.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large false smile.) Now, you listen to me. I know you feel like you can't find someone, but there's a lock for every key. Back home, there's a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could <b title='tall enough. <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAcFBQYFBAcGBgYIBwcICxILCwoKCxYPEA0SGhYbGhkWGRgcICgiHB4mHhgZIzAkJiorLS4tGyIyNTEsNSgsLSz/2wBDAQcICAsJCxULCxUsHRkdLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCwsLCz/wAARCABzANwDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFBgcI/8QANxAAAgEDAwIEBQIFBAIDAAAAAQIDAAQRBRIhMUEGEyJRFGFxgZEHMhUjQmKxUnKCoRYzwfDx/8QAGQEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDAQQF/8QAJhEAAgICAgEEAgMBAAAAAAAAAAECEQMhEjEEExQyQSJRI2Ghgf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A9aFOFJinAV6x5AClpBS0AFLRSYoAWlpMUooAKKKXFBgUUYoosAooooAKKKWgBKKWigBMUUtJQAlGKWigBtBpaQ0AIaQinUlADTTaeabWgFOFNpJH8uMtjpSjEtFchfeLBbXTQ5O8c4HtXP6r+sGnaDL5c9nqF25baoiRVVj7AsefqBS8kjVBvpHp9FcT4O/Vfw74wv8A+HQm4sNQJ2pBdKo809cI6kgt/acE9s12+KFJPoHFx0wFJuAOCeaR3WNSWOMVzs2tAaqINw56Uwp0vFFMhcSRqw9qkFABRRTHkVDgmgB9FAOQDRQAdqKa0gT9xxSqwYZFAC0UUUAFFIWA6mlDA9KACijtRQAlFFBoASkpTSGgBpooNFAAPlVO+u4ooXVjziqsWsRSW+VYftri9a1e4k1XyUJ29SRU3IdRs5Dxlq3iiLVp/wCDeHZ2jB2JdeUJmJ/1qoJBHXGR9R2rzdl1vxhri2/kST35/lsH4CEZ3O5P7e+c4+le7wtbwsst1JIB12QKGmk+Qzwv+5uPYHpVa7uFn1B71YILLIC5kcM4QdAzYBc57mvK8jy1B0ts9LBitXVHOaxpEHhj9KNSs4ZWn8uIPJKAFLzNIgEmO2CFC9wFHeqvhv8AXzV7WCGy12MXcca7fjYo1ecgdC6sQshxxkFSepya2NYt9A1m2ktNWu7qdIWDOlvM0SoezbANpPPBO7Ge2a4vVf0+0sqTomsybgARFeopDZ9pE5Bx2K1LD5aa/LTKSw/9Pa9I1v8A82gJ0HxFpl/LtLNb+WYbhAOu6Nm3DrjIyPnVK88M65YXwu5VR3XnaVZR/wB182X9je6NdqtzE9vIp3RyK3pPsUdePwa6TT/1c8eaTC0Nt4nvWQjG252XO0fIyBiDXXyyPcZE/Tx9OJ7wvjfUNLUJd+H2nVR6jBcYcfQMMH8it7R/F2la/BI1m8sVxDgzWtzH5c0QJwDjoy5GNykj6V4r4QufFv6jiSfXPEV1FpMD+XJ5EUcDTHGSuUCnvgnnHfrXfNodo0ptIWKRpteNIpGUAker7du/Tms924OpbZj8WMlcdHoSXAeLeASo6kDNYmoatGlxkOAK5aTwzYx7HdDDNw7NESrFew3bhggkcgDr7Ci30q0voIWXU3dy4jCvN+4k9F3Hg9QBn+mt9/D7RN+DL6Z1g8SQIFUuvStCy1SK8HpI+1cZPovh3TDs1rxZaQTf1QW486RflxnHft3+VNt/GvgvREMdo+uXm0n1rGiKT/yxT+8guyftJ/R0uuaotmy7mCjOMmtPTJxcWqkHJ+tcU36j+DJmBuvDupy56PIUlPyPL0+DxN+m+pq8JQaJMeVlntiPwyllz75I+9L76H6H9m/tnfMCn7gV+oxTJXEcZYniuLi8LajHbtf+GvEEl7bYZlaC58yJzgHHBwDyeDjAA61VvNc8TadbRRXlmb1GHqkCop577kOAO3qGCR1watDyoS/onLxJrrZq6l4hWCRlVvtV7RNXS7UOzYBHevO7zfPI8rSIQxODux/mprGS+sBgZAPTNW5rtslLG1o9KvtTjgYAMPzU1rfRzQK+4V5hfXt9PjJOR3FWbXU7yG22tn5U3qRWxeDPS/ioc4DjP1qQEMMjoa8ui1u9W6VpD6M8gV1kHiSNbLJYE4oU0zHFo6CadIjgkZpyurIGB4NefjxP8Vq5jyQoOMnvW3f69HBZelhkDtT3RlM6TzEJwGGaaZFBxmvOY/Fky3IDghT3rSTxJuTJY5os2mczY3txBMyMxZDT9U1eHS7dZmiaW6nOyJFjL8nucDA++B7+xhX+YMjHyp9xCb61Fk91NBGzhn8ogFsA4HPHfPSvHlOVaZ2RUb2crPrtyk1w1xMZRAM3DJJwXxlY19gBglupzVCe5luhbQBy9wWE8rFc4I9wOirn7V1jeC1ufEUG2GGHQ7WOMpDu3NM4BLBu5G4lmZuTkfbQ07Q4vDUczRu1xcXHEs0i+pl7KB2X3Hc8mueHj8naOp5UkcLpthqHiK6urmwhkljiRizP6Q7H9oUngtn26da1LLwbr1zalrie3sZd67YpX8zC87v29O3GffpXawSTMgO4BQOFxwB8hSJJIZvYU8sag6ZL1pPoy7TwdZWtxby3t5JehUAmt5IlMEz85JDZ4II468ZzzWRrX6UaBrFzE+jSPpMm4LJAgMscvP8ARuOUY9OpU8cDv18rlhVOTej7hkD3Hao8ndRZnKXbM60s4PDlmtnpyNbxoT6M8lj1LHu3HX5YroNBvhc2rSMPQvYnJBHb/wC9aLuxttegOpQuI70HbPEf2l8fuHtu6g/X2rMjtzZ5ILL/AEuDxuAPQ/L51Lk3qR2qqtGhqWpNFayXLIZSw3FeA20Zx3xjliR3x1rzXXrVru5dmX/1DzEU8gNzgjsD1P1YCuv1KSa7AWNQiM2Sxx+0dsdQOMcVgyxy7fLTaBIWcwo2WfHIO49B1Jzx0HvVsclFCyts5+G5lsGSCSx8wLGh3RkAngZOG6nnnP4GKt/xmzK8u9uTxllIPy55H4rUkszMXkeQBNm3gHhcEH74/wAjvmqU9iGlWN4AXMYTKn0lmI/xhj+KyoMy2hILu0mP8u6hlY/3ZY/g1Zf4eJAbq4jgRlJBZucD2UZPy56+9Zp8OxTKrJGrI2HAxyQBJuB+RAT8j3rPl8Gx28sU1rObaTO11GWUNySCCc8gcdq30ovpmcmjd086qb2eTRLXUIZVAO+yDo6L23FCOoGcHPQ4rUi/UfxFZL5eoSR6iiZJS6QrKh75dcMv/JTW94V0fS9BEi2t3O12VEzJLx/LcDaV/wBajkZBOGyDgirt9HZ6iipeW8dwFI2sw9S49mHIHyzg03ou6YjzpPRR0TXNM8XtPbkwaTf4wgvQzwuSCc+Yq7CP7XIJ689K0pvBWt2POxdPfGd1teedbuAOrwygFc88q54HFQSsGjeONI4kPVI1CqfsOKistd1LRWWK3ufMtlOfhpvXF9h1X/iR966IwyJVFk3ni3+SGie9tXCX9ohToLi2bdGf9ynDL/3zViS6iAAGMHvTP45bS3AHlva7z6gzGSIfcDcB9Q31FJPaweZyDCsoZhJGoeJiAerLkL+QfrW8q+aoHjjNfxskXypQemad5KBSBWZGVt5CVLuhPQEbh9Ox/IrVtpra89ME6l+mxgUbPyB6/bNE3x2nog4SXaKnwKCQsvBp7x7htJJHzqy8RiJBBz7UixE+oimeWTVipfRWisUZssOaVrdFYgYxVp0ZE4qvsfNKs0r7McaKlugI4xiq85eOdWJ6Gn2peO3BNZ9/JIRvB+lYo26HbO

<s>The laundry room.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Sure. One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Careful, you're using too much <b title='fabric softener [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downy">Wiki</a>]'>Downey</b>. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It is nice, isn't it?<br>
<i>Penny</i>(Arriving) Mrs. Cooper. Hi!<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, hello, darlin'.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>It was in my weekly e-mail <b title='a very enjoyable or thrilling experience'>blast</b>. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red <b title='solid waste from the body, feces, poop'>stool</b> from beets leads to cancer scare.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>So, how've you been?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Good, good.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while. I'm getting back out there.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? (Holds up a <b title="a skimpy dress or skirt etc is very short and does not cover very much of a woman's body">skimpy</b> top)<br>
<i>Penny</i>Well, it's super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in <b title='promiscuous - having many sexual partners'>promiscuity</b> futures.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Hon, you think maybe the reason why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?<br>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacups">Wiki</a>] ↗breasts'>spin the teacups</b>. Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, not crazy at all. And don't <b title='blame yourself too much for sth'>beat yourself up</b>. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Now that will not be in this week's e-mail blast.
<s>The apartment.</s>
<i>Howard</i>So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, <b title='used to express surprise'>my word</b>, a trip to the heavens. If you ever wanna live there eternally, I've got a good book you could read.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Thanks, but I watch the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas">Wiki</a>]'>Charlie Brown Christmas special</b> every year, so I get the gist.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>I bet your mom is really proud of you.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Nope. She says if I don't <b title='decide not to do sth'>back out</b> she's gonna go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I've worked up a couple of Q's that will <b title='if you are stumped by a question or problem, you are unable to find an answer to it'>stump</b> his sorry A.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel <b title='sb who has won a prize for their achievements, esp a nobel prize ↗poet laureate, laurel'>laureate</b>?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom to see <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Sign">Wiki</a>]'>the Hollywood sign</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Wax_Museum">Wiki</a>]'>the wax museum</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame">Wiki</a>]'>the Walk of Fame</b>.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Ooh, maybe a little <b title='a two-mile long street, primarily in Beverly Hills, California... luxury-goods stores... shopping district and a major tourist attraction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo_Drive">Wiki</a>]'>Rodeo Drive</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Well, I can't spend twelve hundred dollars on a handbag, but it's free to look upon those who do with <b title='morally right and good'>righteous</b> condemnation.<br>
<i>Howard</i>What do you say?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.<br>
<i>Howard</i>(After Raj whispers to him) He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
<s>The kitchen.</s>
<i>Leonard</i>These are delicious.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we're not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Mom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Apology accepted.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Great. Now, you're gonna love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that <b title='[<a href="http://www.jesuscreated.org/Biblical/World_History_short.htm">World History According to the Bible</a>] Age of the Universe: Around 6178 Years Old'>the universe is older than 6,000 years</b>, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum <b title='a Christian hymn (a song of praise, esp one praising God and sung by Christians) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace">Wiki</a>]'>Amazing Grace</b> during those parts.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>I am still going out with your friends.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I wanna go sightseeing. So why don't you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I'm not going, and you can't make me.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Well, then you are going to stand there all day.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax <b title=' an American actor and politician. He was the 40th President of the United States (1981–89), and served as the 33rd Governor of California (1967–75) prior to his presidency. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan">Wiki</a>]'>Ronald Reagan</b> for his service to our country.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>We appear to be at a <b title='↗intersection, junction'>crossroads</b> in our relationship, Mother.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Well, I guess we are.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Sorry. Syrup.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>All right, Mom. When you're at the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley%27s_Believe_It_or_Not!">Wiki</a>]'>Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum</b>, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard's hand)
<i>Leonard</i>I hadn't-
<s>Amy's apartment.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you getting sick?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn't making you a priority?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Sheldon, we're all animals. And <b title='used when you admit that sth is true'>granted</b>, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you're just like everybody else.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you're not <b title='come down with - get an illness that is not very serious'>coming down with</b> a cold?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You'd love that, wouldn't you?
<s>A church.</s>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, this one's sweet. You know, for your <b title='string of beads for keeping count of prayers'>rosary</b> <b title='↗rattlesnake'>rattlers</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Mrs. Cooper, we-we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>My goodness, it's a wonder you people in California can talk at all.<br>
<i>Penny</i>This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Hey, they have wine here, don't they?<br>
<i>Raj</i>(Pointing at a <b title='the act of killing sb by fastening them to a cross and leaving them to die'>crucifixion</b> statue) Hey, none of our gods have <b title='the muscles in your abdomen ↗pecs, biceps, triceps'>abs</b> like that.<br>
<i>Howard</i>Yep, that's the last Jew who did <b title='↗push-up, press-up, chin-up, pull-up'>sit-ups</b>. And look where it got him.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Hey, while we're here, why don't we all do some praying? Let's put a little <b title='a service or services in a church'>church</b> in this church.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Oh, I'm not sure we should.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>It's easy. I'll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from <b title='Sodom and Gomorrah - two cities in the Bible that were destroyed by God as punishment for the sexual behavior of the people who lived there'>Gomorrah</b>, California. I wanna thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also wanna thank you for the continued strength not to <b title='knock sb unconscious'>coldcock</b> him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.<br>
<i>Penny</i>Okay, um, hey, God. What's up? Um, I'm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking <b title='a drug [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine">Wiki</a>]'>meth</b>. But, no cops. Be cool.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbor. Could probably use that chat you had with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene">Wiki</a>]'>Mary Magdalene</b>. Leonard, you're up. <b title='[<a href="http://answerparty.com/question/answer/is-wasserman-a-jewish-last-name">Is Wasserman a Jewish last name?</a>]'>Wasserman</b>, you're <b title='ready for action, duty etc'>on deck</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Okay. I don't know, it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She's all the way in India. That-that would be great.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that <b title='field of activity'>front</b>. How about you?<br>
<i>Howard</i>Oh, me? No. Thanks, I'm good. I'm really just trying not to <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>] [<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">Yoda</a>]'>burst into flames</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Rajesh?<br>
<i>Howard</i>He says he's having trouble dropping those last five pounds.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Huh, I might've gone with the talking-to-girls thing.<br>
<i>Howard</i>No, you only get one wish.
<s>A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next to him.</s>
<i>Sheldon</i>Look at the two of us. Me, a <b title='regarded as very good ↗renowned'>highly regarded</b> physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labors as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or <b title='sb who cleans and polishes shoes for a living'>bootblack</b>. But deep down inside, apparently we're just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, kinda pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) <b title='sb who thinks they are very clever and likes to show people this in an annoying way'>Smarty-pants</b>.
<s>The kitchen.</s>
<i>Penny</i>Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>You take notes, darlin'. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He'll die at 50 but his love will be true.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>(Entering, soaked) I need a tissue.This one got wet.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Here.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thank you. Yeah, I've learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what <b title='count - be important or valuable'>counts</b>, we're the same. (Sneezes)<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Sweetheart, are you sick?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I hope so, because if this is well, life isn't worth living.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We've got to get you to bed.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Okay.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Don't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Of course.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>You can have whatever you want.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Thanks, Mom.You're the best.
<s>Sheldon's bedroom.</s>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Boy, last time I put <b title='a mentholated topical cream [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicks_VapoRub">Wiki</a>]'>VapoRub</b> on you, you didn't have hair on your chest.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>I know, it filled in last year. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>And whose fault was that?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Yours.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Shelly, you're not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>No, we don't. The one we have works great.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Sweetheart, you are a grown man.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Or maybe I'm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I'm still basically a toddler.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Oh, I so should've taken you to Houston.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Does this mean you're not going to sing Soft Kitty?<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur-<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(At door) Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Get out!<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Well, that was rude.<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty-<br>
<i>Sheldon</i>What are you trying to <b title='succeed in playing a trick on sb, committing a crime, etc'>pull</b>, Mom? From the top.<br>
<i>Mrs Cooper</i>(To God) This is what I'm talking about. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...
